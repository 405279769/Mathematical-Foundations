## Subsitution Method 

Let $y$ be a composition function of $F$ with $g$:
$$y=F(g(x)).$$
Suppose that the function $g$ is differentiable on an open interval $I$ and that the function $F$ is differentiable on an open interval containing the image of $I$ under $g$. By the chain rule, the composition function $F\circ g$ is differentiable on $I$:
$$\frac{d}{dx}F(g(x))=\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{d g(x)}\frac{d g(x)}{dx}=F'(g(x))g'(x),$$

Since the integration is the reverse process of differentiation, we have 
$$\int F'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)dx=\int f(g(x))\cdot g'(x)dx=F(g(x))+C,$$
where $F'=f$.

**Change of variable method** Putting $u=g(x)$ and using $du=g'(x)dx$, we get
$$\int f(g(x))g'(x)dx=\int f(u)du=F(u)+C.$$

**Remarks** The notations $du$ and $dx$ are called differentials. They are related by the fact that if $\Delta x$ is small, then $\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x}$ is approximately equal to $g'(x)$, that is 
$$\Delta u=g'(x)\Delta x.$$
In the limiting situation, we have $du=g'(x)dx$.

**Example** Find $\int(x^2+1)^2 2x dx, \int\frac{\ln x}{x}dx, \int x^2e^{x^3}dx, \int\sin(2x-3)dx$

**Substitution method for definite integrals**
$$\int_a^bf(g(x))g'(x)dx=\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(u)du$$
where $g$ is a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and $f$ is a function defined and continuous on an open interval $I$ containing the image of $[a,b]$ under $g$.

**Example** Evaluate $\int_0^4x\sqrt{x^2+9}dx, \int_0^1(x+1)e^{x^2+2x}dx, \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sin x\cos xdx$

**Example** Find the area of the region that lies between the $x$-axis and the graph of $y=xe^{-x^2}$ for $-1\le x\le 2$.

## Integration of Rational Functions 

$$\int \frac{A}{ax+b}dx\\=A\int\frac{1}{ax+b}dx\\=A\cdot\frac{1}{a}\cdot\ln|ax+b|+C$$
We consider three cases when integrate 
$$\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}$$

**Case 1** $b^2-4ac>0$

The denominator can be factorized as $a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$. Moreover, there exists contants $\alpha, \beta$ such that 
$$\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}=\frac{\alpha}{x-x_1}+\frac{\beta}{x-x_2}$$
The above process is called **partial-fraction decomposition** of the rational function.

**Example** Find $\int\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x-3}dx$.

**Case 2** $b^2-4ac=0$.

The denominator can be factorized as $a(x-x_1)^2$. Moreover, there exists contants $\alpha, \beta$ such that 
$$\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}=\frac{\alpha}{x-x_1}+\frac{\beta}{(x-x_1)^2}.$$

**Example** Find $\int\frac{2x+3}{x^2-2x+1}dx$

**Case 3** $b^2-4ac<0$

The denominator can be written as $a((x+s)^2+t^2)$

**Subcase 3a** $A=0$
$$\int\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}dx=\frac{B}{at}\tan^{-1}\frac{x+s}{t} +C$$

**Subcase 3b** $Ax+B=k(2ax+b)$
$$\int\frac{Ax+B}{ax^2+bx+c}dx=\int\frac{k(2ax+b)}{ax^2+bx+c}$$
which can be integrated using substitution $u=ax^2+bx+c$.

**Case 3 in general** We rewrite the numerator as a sum of two terms: the first one is a multiple of the derivative of the denominator and the second one is a constant.

**Example** Find $\int\frac{2x+3}{x^2+4x+13}dx$

## Integration by Parts 

The technique in integration that corresponds to the product rule in differentiation is called **integration by parts**.

Let $f$ and $g$ be functions that are differentiable on an open interval $(a, b)$. By the product rule, we have 
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( f(x)g(x) \right)=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x), ~~ a<x<b,$$
which, written in terms of integration,  becomes 
$$\int f'(x)g(x)dx + \int f(x)g'(x)dx =f(x)g(x), ~~ a<x<b. $$

Or we have 
$$\int f(x)g'(x)dx = f(x)g(x) - \int f'(x)g(x)dx, ~~ a<x<b,$$
in which $\int f'(x)g(x)dx$ is easier to find than $\int f(x)g'(x)dx$.

**Example** Find $\int xe^xdx, \int x\cos xdx, \int \ln x dx$.

## Applications

### Consumers' and Producer's surplus

**Consumer's surplus** The excess cost that a person would have been prepared to pay for goods
over and above what is actually paid.

**Producerâ€™s surplus** The excess revenue that a producer has actually received over and above the
lower revenue that it was prepared to accept for the supply of its goods.

**Net investment** Rate of change of capital stock over time: $$I = \frac{dK}{dt}.$$

### Probability

**Definition** A variable whose values depend on the outcome of a random process is called a random variable.

**Example**

1. Suppose a die is rolled and $X_1$ is the number that turns up. *Discrete random variable*

2. The life (in months) of a certain computer part. *Continuous random variable*

**Definition** Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with values in $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$. A **probability function** of $X$ is a function $f$ with domain $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$ such that 

1. $0\le f(x_i)$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$;

2. $f(x_1)+\cdots+f(x_n)=1$.

**Probabilities of Events for Discrete Random Variables** Suppose that $X$ is a discrete random variable with values in the set $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ and that $f$ is a probability function of $X$.

- An *event* for $X$ is a subset of $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$.

- The probability of an event $E$, denoted by $P(E)$, is the number given by 
$$P(E)=\sum_{x_i\in E}f(x_i).$$

**Definition** Let $X$ be a *continuous* random variable in $[a,\infty)$. A **probability function** of $X$ is a function $f$ with domain $[a,\infty)$ such that 

1. $0\le f(x_i)$ for all $x\in[a,\infty)$;

2. $\int_a^\infty f(x)dx=1$.

**Remark** $\int_a^\infty f(x)dx$ is called an *improper integral* and is defined by 
$$\int_a^\infty f(x)dx=\underset{R\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\int_0^Rf(x)dx,$$
provided that the limit exists.

**Example** Find $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}dx$.

**Probabilities of Events for Continuous Random Variables** Suppose that $X$ is a continuous random variable with values in the interval $(a,\infty]$ and that $f$ is a probability function of $X$.

- An *event* for $X$ is usually an interval contained in $[a,\infty)$; such events are represented by $(\alpha\le X\le \beta)$.

- The probability of an event $(\alpha\le X\le\beta)$, denoted by $P(\alpha\le X\le\beta)$, is the number given by 
$$P(\alpha\le X\le\beta)=\int_\alpha^\beta f(x)dx.$$

**Remark** It does not matter whether we include the endpoints $\alpha,\beta$. For a continuous random variable $X$, the probability that $X$ equals a specific value is $0$.
