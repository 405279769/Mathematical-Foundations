# Linear Equations

#### Algebra {-}

- **Equation** Equality of two algebraic expressions which is true only for certain values of the variable.

- **Identity** Equality of two algebraic expressions which is true for all values of the variable. 

- **Linear equation** An equation of the form $dx + ey = f$.

- **Factor** Part of an expression which, when multiplied by all the other factors, gives the complete expression.

- **Like terms** Multiples of the same combination of algebraic symbols.

- **Algebraic fraction**  Ratio of two expressions; $p(x)/q(x)$ where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are algebraic expressions such as $ax^2 + bx + c$ or $dx + e$.

- **Equivalent fractions** Fractions which may appear different but which have the same numerical value.

- **Denominator** The number (or expression) on the bottom of a fraction.

- **Numerator** The number (or expression) on the top of a fraction.

- **Difference of two squares** The algebraic result which states that $a^2 âˆ’ b^2 = (a + b)(a âˆ’ b)$.

- **Distributive law** The law of arithmetic which states that $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ for any numbers, $a, b, c$.

- **Factorisation** The process of writing an expression as a product of simpler expressions using brackets.

- **Simultaneous linear equations** A set of linear equations in which there are (usually) the same number of equations and unknowns. The solution consists of values of the unknowns which satisfy all of the equations at the same time.

- **Elimination method** the method in which variables are removed from a system of simultaneous equations by adding (or subtracting) a multiple of one equation to (or from) a multiple of another.

- **Absolute value (Modulus)** The positive value or magnitude of a number.

- **Interval** The set of all real numbers between (and possibly including) two given numbers.

- **Closed interval** The set of all real numbers between and including two given numbers: $a â‰¤ x â‰¤ b$ or $[a,b]$. 

- **Open interval** The set of all real numbers between but excluding two given numbers: $a < x < b$ or $(a,b)$. 

#### Graphs {-}

- **Number line** An infinite line on which the points represent real numbers by their (signed) distance from the origin.

- **Coordinates** A set of numbers that determine the position of a point relative to a set of axes. 

- **Origin** The point where the coordinate axes intersect.

- **Intercept** The point(s) where a graph crosses one of the coordinate axes.

- **Slope of a line** Also known as the **gradient**, it is the change in the value of $y$ when $x$ increases by $1$ unit.

- **$x$ axis** The horizontal coordinate axis pointing from left to right. 

- **$y$ axis** The vertical coordinate axis pointing upwards.

#### Functions {-}

- **Function** A rule that assigns to each incoming number, $x$, a uniquely defined outgoing number, $y$. 

- **Parameter** A constant whose value affects the specific values but not the general form of a mathematical expression, such as the constants $a, b$ and $c$ in $ax^2 + bx + c$.

- **Coefficient** A numerical multiplier of the variables in an algebraic term, such as the numbers $4$ and $7$ in the expression $4x + 7yz^2$.

- **Decreasing function** A function, $y = f(x)$, in which $y$ decreases as $x$ increases.

- **Increasing function** A function, $y = f(x)$, in which $y$ increases as $x$ increases.

- **Independent variable** A variable whose value determines that of the dependent variable; in $y = f(x)$, the independent variable is $x$.

- **Dependent variable** A variable whose value is determined by that taken by the independent variables; in $y = f(x)$, the dependent variable is $y$.

- **Domain** The numbers which are used as inputs to a function.

- **Range** The numbers which form the set of outputs from a function.

- **Inverse function** A function, written as $f^{-1}$, which reverses  the effect of a given function, $f$, so that $x=f^{-1}(y)$ when $y=f(x)$.

#### Supply and demand analysis {-}

- **Modelling** The creation of a piece of mathematical theory which represents (a simplification of) some aspect of practical economics.

- **Demand function** A relationship between the quantity demanded and various factors that affect demand, including price.

- **Supply function** A relationship between the quantity supplied and various factors that affect supply, including price.

- **Transpose a formula** The rearrangement of a formula to make one of the other letters the subject.
