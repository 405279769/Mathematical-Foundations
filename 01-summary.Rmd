#### Algebra {-}

- **Equation** Equality of two algebraic expressions which is true only for certain values of the variable.

- **Identity** Equality of two algebraic expressions which is true for all values of the variable. 

- **Linear equation** An equation of the form $dx + ey = f$.

- **Factor** Part of an expression which, when multiplied by all the other factors, gives the complete expression.

- **Like terms** Multiples of the same combination of algebraic symbols.

- **Algebraic fraction**  Ratio of two expressions; $p(x)/q(x)$ where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are algebraic expressions such as $ax^2 + bx + c$ or $dx + e$.

- **Equivalent fractions** Fractions which may appear different but which have the same numerical value.

- **Denominator** The number (or expression) on the bottom of a fraction.

- **Numerator** The number (or expression) on the top of a fraction.

- **Difference of two squares** The algebraic result which states that $a^2 âˆ’ b^2 = (a + b)(a âˆ’ b)$.

- **Distributive law** The law of arithmetic which states that $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ for any numbers, $a, b, c$.

- **Factorisation** The process of writing an expression as a product of simpler expressions using brackets.

- **Simultaneous linear equations** A set of linear equations in which there are (usually) the same number of equations and unknowns. The solution consists of values of the unknowns which satisfy all of the equations at the same time.

- **Elimination method** the method in which variables are removed from a system of simultaneous equations by adding (or subtracting) a multiple of one equation to (or from) a multiple of another.

- **Absolute value (Modulus)** The positive value or magnitude of a number.

- **Interval** The set of all real numbers between (and possibly including) two given numbers.

- **Open interval** The set of all real numbers between but excluding two given numbers: $a < x < b$ or $(a,b)$. 

#### Graphs {-}

- **Number line** An infinite line on which the points represent real numbers by their (signed) distance from the origin.

- **Coordinates** A set of numbers that determine the position of a point relative to a set of axes. 

- **Origin** The point where the coordinate axes intersect.

- **Intercept** The point(s) where a graph crosses one of the coordinate axes.

- **$y$ axis** The vertical coordinate axis pointing upwards.

#### Functions {-}

This part is from the Formal Mathematics section of this chapter. 

- **Function** A rule that assigns to each incoming number, $x$, a uniquely defined outgoing number, $y$. 

- **Parameter** A constant whose value affects the specific values but not the general form of a mathematical expression, such as the constants $a, b$ and $c$ in $ax^2 + bx + c$.

- **Coefficient** A numerical multiplier of the variables in an algebraic term, such as the numbers $4$ and $7$ in the expression $4x + 7yz^2$.

- **Decreasing function** A function, $y = f(x)$, in which $y$ decreases as $x$ increases.

- **Increasing function** A function, $y = f(x)$, in which $y$ increases as $x$ increases.

- **Independent variable** A variable whose value determines that of the dependent variable; in $y = f(x)$, the independent variable is $x$.

- **Dependent variable** A variable whose value is determined by that taken by the independent variables; in $y = f(x)$, the dependent variable is $y$.

- **Domain** The numbers which are used as inputs to a function.

- **Range** The numbers which form the set of outputs from a function.

- **Inverse function** A function, written as $f^{-1}$, which reverses  the effect of a given function, $f$, so that $x=f^{-1}(y)$ when $y=f(x)$.

#### Supply and demand analysis {-}

- **Modelling** The creation of a piece of mathematical theory which represents (a simplification of) some aspect of practical economics.

- **Demand function** A relationship between the quantity demanded and various factors that affect demand, including price.

- **Transpose a formula** The rearrangement of a formula to make one of the other letters the subject.

# Non-linear Equations

#### Quadratic functions {-}

- **Quadratic function** A function of the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ where $a\neq0.$

- **Solution formula** The solution of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$

- **Square root** The solutions of the equation $x^2=c$ which are written as $\pm\sqrt{c}$.

- **Discriminant** The number $b^2-4ac$, which is used to indicate the number of solutions of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0.$

- **Parabola** The shape of the graph of a quadratic function.

- **U-shaped curve** A curve bends upwards, like the letter U.

#### Polynomials {-}

This part is contained in the Formal Mathematics part at the end of this chapter. We put it here since it is an extension of quadratic functions.

- **Polynomial** A function of the form $a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_0$. The highest power $n$ is called the degree of the polynomial.

- **Continuous** When $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)=f(a)$ at all points in the domain.

- **Discontinuous** When the graph of the function has jumps or gaps.

#### Profit analysis {-}

- **Total cost** The sum of the total variable and fixed costs: $TC = TVC + FC$.

- **Fixed costs** Total costs that are independent of output.

- **Variable costs** Total costs that change according to the amount of output produced.

- **Average cost** Total cost per unit of output: $AC = TC/Q$.

- **Rectangular hyperbola (L-shaped curve)** A hyperbola with horizontal and vertical asymptotes bending like the letter L, such as the function $f(x)=a+b/x$.

- **Total revenue** A firmâ€™s total earnings from the sales of a good: $TR = PQ$.

- **Profit** Total revenue minus total cost: $\pi = TR âˆ’ TC$.

#### Indices and logarithms {-}

- $M=b^n$ is called the **exponential form** of $M$ to **base** $b$. The number $n$ is referred to as the **index, power, exponent** or the logarithm of $M$ to base $b$, $\log_b M=n$.

- **Four rules of indices**

  1. $$b^m\times b^n=b^{m+n}$$
  
  2. $$b^m\div b^n=b^{m-n}$$
  
  3. $$(b^m)^n=b^{mn}$$
  
  4. $$(ab)^n=a^nb^n$$
  
- **Three rules of logarithms**
  
  1. $$\log_b(x\times y)=\log_bx +\log_b y$$
  
  2. $$\log_b(x\div y)=\log_bx -\log_b y$$
  
  3. $$\log_bx^m=m\log_bx$$
  
- **Homogeneous function** A function with the property that when all of the inputs are multiplied by a constant, $\lambda$, the output is multiplied by $\lambda^n$ where $n$ is the degree of homogeneity.

#### Exponential and natural logarithm functions {-}

- **Euler number** $$e=\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m$$

- **Exponential function** The function $f(x)=e^x=\exp(x)$ in which the base is the number $e=2.7183$.

- **Natural logarithm** A logarithm to base $e$. IF $M=e^n$ then n is the natural logarithm of $M$, and we write $n=\ln M$.

#### Percentages {-}

- **Index number** The scale factor of a variable measured from the base year multiplied by 100.

- **Inflation** The percentage increase in the level of prices over a $12$-month period.

- **Nominal data** Monetary values prevailing at the time that they were measured.

- **Real data** Monetary values adjusted to take inflation into account.

#### Compound interest {-}

- **Simple interest** The interest which is paid directly to the investor instead of being added to the original amount.

$$S=P\times(1+rt)$$

- **Compound interest** The interest which is added on to the initial investment, so that this will itself gain interest in subsequent time periods.

$$S=P\times(1+r)^t$$

- **Continuous compounding** The limiting value when interest is compounded with ever-increasing frequency.

$$S=P\times e^{rt}$$

- **Annual percentage rate** The equivalent annual interest paid for a loan, taking into account the compounding over a variety of time periods.

- **Principal** The value of the original sum invested.

- **Future value** The final value of an investment after one or more time periods.

#### Geometric series {-}

- **Arithmetic progression** A sequence of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive terms; the $n$th term takes the form, $a+bn$.

- **Geometric progression** A sequence of numbers with a constant ratio between consecutive terms; the $n$th term takes the form of $ar^{n-1}$. 

- **Geometric ratio** The constant multiplier $r$ in a geometric series.

- **Formula of sum of geometric series** 

$$\sum_{i=1}^n ar^{i-1}=a\left(\frac{r^n-1}{r-1}\right)$$

- **Sinking fund** A fixed sum of money saved at regular intervals which is used to fund some future financial commitment.

#### Investment appraisal {-}

- **Net present value (NPV)** The present value of a revenue flow minus the original cost. NPV is preferred than IRR sometimes.
