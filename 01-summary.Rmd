##### Utility {-}

- When the utility is maximized, we have the ratio of marginal utility to price is the same for all goods consumed.
$$\frac{U_1}{P_1}=\frac{U_2}{P_2}$$

#### Lagrange multipliers {-}

- **Lagrangian** The function $f(x, y) + \lambda[M âˆ’ \phi(x, y)]$, where $f(x, y)$ is the objective function and $\phi(x, y) = M$ is the constraint. The stationary point of this function is the solution of the associated constrained optimization problem.

- **Lagrange multiplier**: The number $\lambda$ which is used in the Lagrangian function. In economics this gives the approximate change in the optimal value of the objective function when the value of the constraint is increased by $1$ unit.
