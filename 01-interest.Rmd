# Interest rate

## Key concepts

### Functions {-}

- Accumulation function $$a(t)$$

- Discount function $$a^{-1}(t)$$

### Interest rate {-}

- Effective rate of interest/discount $$i,d$$

- Simple interest $$a(t)=1+it$$

- Compound interest $$a(t)=(1+i)^t$$

- Discount factor $$v=(1+i)^{-1}$$

- Accumulation factor of $t$ years $$(1+i)^t$$

- Discount factor of $t$ years $$(1+i)^{-t}$$

- Nominal rate of interest/discount $$i^{(m)},d^{(m)}$$

- Force of interest $$\delta$$

### Values {-}

- Accumulated value (future value) 

- Present value

## Key equations

### Interest rate and discount rate {-}

$$i=\frac{d}{1-d}$$

$$d=\frac{i}{1+i}$$

$$d=iv$$

$$v=1-d$$

$$i-d=id$$

### Accumulation and discount {-}

$$a(t)=(1+i)^t=(1-d)^{-t}$$

$$a^{-1}(t)=(1+i)^{-t}=(1-d)^t=v^t$$



## Homework

### Week 1 {-}

#### Problem 1 {-}

John invests $X$ in a fund growing in accordance with the accumulation function implied by the amount function
$$A(t)=4t^2+8t+4.$$
Edna invests $X$ in another fund growing in accordance with the accumulation function implied by the amount function $$A(t)=4t^2+2.$$
When does Edna's investment *exceed* Johnâ€™s?

#### Problem 2 {-}

What deposit made today will provide for a payment of $\$1000$ in 1 year and $\$2000$ in 3 years, if the effective rate of interest is $7.5\%$?

#### Problem 3 {-}

Company $X$ received the approval to start no more than two projects in the current calendar year.
Three different projects were recommended, each of which requires an investment of 800 to be made at the beginning of the year.

The cash flows for each of the three projects are as follows:
```{r,echo=FALSE,}
table1<-data.frame(matrix(c(1,500,500,500, 
         2,500,300,250, 
         3,-175,-175,-175,
         4,100,150,200,
         5,0,200,200),nrow=5,byrow = T))
names(table1)<-c("End of year", "Project A", "Project B", "Project C")
knitr::kable(table1,caption = "The cash flows of the three projects.")
```

The company uses an annual effective interest rate of $10\%$ to discount its cash flows.
