## Exponents {-}

In $a^n$, $n$ and $a$ are called the **exponent** and **base** respectively.

**Rules for exponents**

1. $a^ma^n=a^{m+n}$

2. $\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}$

3. $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$

4. $(ab)^n=a^nb^n$

5. $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}$

## Algebraic Identities and Algebraic Expressions {-}

**Identities** Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers. Then we have

1. $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$ 

2. $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$

3. $(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2$

## Solving Linear Equations {-}

**Definition** A solution to $F(x)=0$ is a real number $x_0$ such that $F(x_0)=0$.

**Definition** We say that two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution(s).

## Solving Quadratic Equations {-}

A quadratic equation (in one unknown) is an equation that can be written in the form
$$ax^2+bx+c=0$$
where $a,b$ and $c$ are constants and $a\neq0$. To solve this equations, we can use the Factorization Method or the Quadratic Formula.


**Quadratic Formula** Solutions to Equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by
$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$
$b^2âˆ’4ac$ is called the *discriminant*

## Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem {-}

**Remainder Theorem** If a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $xâˆ’c$, where $c$ is a constant, the remainder is $p(c)$.

**Factor Theorem** $(xâˆ’c)$ is a factor of a polynomial $p(x)$ if and only if $p(c)=0$.

## Solving Linear Inequalities {-}

**Definition** A solution to an inequality $F(x)<0$ is a real number $x_0$ such that $F(x0)<0$. The definition also applies to other types of inequalities.

**Rules for Inequalities** Let $a,b$ and $c$ be real numbers. Then the following holds.

1. If $a<b$, then $a+c<b+c$.

2. If $a<b$ and $c>0$, then $ac<bc$.

3. If $a<b$ and $c<0$, then $ac>bc$. Note: The inequality is reversed.

4. If $a<b$ and $bâ‰¤c$, then $a<c$.

5. If $a<b$ and $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, then $\frac{1}{a}>\frac{1}{b}$.

## Lines {-}

A line equation in two unknowns $x$ and $y$ is an equation that can be written in the form
$$ax+by+c=0$$
where $a,b$ and $c$ are constants with $a,b$ not both $0$. More generally, an equation in two unknowns $x$ and $y$ is an equation that can be written in the form
$$F(x,y)=0$$
where $F$ is a function (from a collection of ordered pairs into $\mathbb{R}$).


**Definition** An ordered pair (of real numbers) is a pair of real numbers $x_0$, $y_0$ enclosed in side parenthesis: $(x_0,y_0)$.

**Definition** A solution to Equation (??) is an ordered pair $(x_0,y_0)$ such that $F(x_0,y_0)=0$.


**Rectangular Coordinate System** Given a plane, there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in the plane and ordered pairs of real numbers. The plane described in this way is called the **Cartesian plane** or the **rectangular coordinate plane**.

The $x$- and $y$-axes divide the (rectangular) coordinate plane into 4 regions (called quadrants):

1. Quadrant I = $\{(a;b):a>0~~ \text{and}~~ b>0 \}$;

1. Quadrant II = $\{(a;b):a<0~~ \text{and}~~ b>0 \}$;

1. Quadrant III = $\{(a;b):a<0~~ \text{and}~~ b<0 \}$;

1. Quadrant IV = $\{(a;b):a>0~~ \text{and}~~ b<0 \}$;

**Lines in the Coordinate Plane** Consider the following equation 
\begin{equation}
Ax+By+C=0 (\#eq:line)
\end{equation}

where $A,B$ and $C$ are constants with $A,B$ not both zero. It is not difficult to see that the equation has infinitely many solutions. Each solution $(x_0,y_0)$ represents a point in the (rectangular) coordinate plane. The collection of all solutions (points) form a line, called the graph of Equation \@ref(eq:line).

**Definition** For a non-vertical line $l$, its slope (denoted by $m$) is defined to be
$$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
where $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are any two distinct points lying on the line.

**Equations for Lines** Let $l$ be a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane.

- Suppose $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point lying on  $l$ and $m$ is the slope. Then an equation for $l$ can be written in the form
$$yâˆ’y_1=m(xâˆ’x_1)$$
called a **point-slope form** for $l$.

- Suppose the $y$-intercept of $l$ is $(0,b)$ and the slope of $l$ is $m$. Then a point-slope form for $l$ is
$$yâˆ’b=m(xâˆ’0)$$
which can be written as
$$y=mx+b$$
called the **slope-intercept form** for $l$.

**Parallel and Perpendicular Lines** Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be (non-vertical) lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. Then

1. $l_1$ and $l_2$ are parallel if and only if $m_1=m_2$.

2. $l_1$ and $l_2$ are perpendicular to each other if and only if $m_1\cdot m_2=-1$.


## Pythagoras Theorem, Distance Formula and Circles {-}

**Pythagoras Theorem** Let $a,b$ and $c$ be the (lengths of the) sides of a right-angled triangle where $c$ is the hypotenuse.Then we have
$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

**Distance Formula** Let $P=(x1,y1)$ and $Q=(x2,y2)$. Then the distance $PQ$ between $P$ and $Q$ is $$PQ=(x_2âˆ’x_1)^2+(y_2âˆ’y_1)^2$$


**Equation of Circles** Let $C$ be the circle with center at $(h,k)$ and radius $r$. Then an equation for $C$ is
$$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$$

## Parabola {-}

The graph of
$$y=ax^2+bx+c$$
where $a\neq 0$, is a *parabola*. The parabola intersects the $x$-axis at two distinct points if $b^2âˆ’4ac>0$. It touches the $x$-axis (one intersection point only) if $b^2âˆ’4ac=0$ and does not intersect the $x$-axis if $b^2âˆ’4ac<0$.

- If $a>0$, the parabola opens upward and there is a lowest point (called the *vertex* of the parabola).

- If $a<0$, the parabola opens downward and there is a highest point (vertex).

The vertical line that passes through the vertex is called the axis of symmetry because the parabola is symmetric about this line.

## Systems of Equations {-}

A *system of two equations in two unknowns* $x$ and $y$ can be written as
$$
\begin{cases}
F_1(x,y)=0\\
F_2(x,y)=0
\end{cases}
$$

Usually, each equation represents a curve in the coordinate plane. Solving the system means to find all ordered pairs $(x_0,y_0)$ such that $F_1(x_0,y_0)=0$ and $F_2(x_0,y_0)=0$, that is, to find all points $(x_0,y_0)$ that lies on the
intersection of the two curves.

To solve a system of two linear equations (with two unknowns $x$ and $y$)
$$
\begin{cases}
ax+by+c=0\\
dx+ey+f=0
\end{cases}
$$

we can use *elimination or substitution*.
