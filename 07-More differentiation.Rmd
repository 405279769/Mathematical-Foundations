# More differentiation

## Chain rule {-}

**The chain rule** Differentiate the outer function and multiply by the derivative of the inner function. A composite function is given by $h(x)=f(g(x))$, then the derivative of it is $h'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x)$.

## Implicit differentiation {-}

**Definition** Implicit differentiation is a technique for differentiating functions that are not given in the usual form y = f (x).

**Example** Find the slope of the line tangent to the circle $ x^2 + y^2 = 4 $ at the point $ (\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}) $

**Example** Use implicit differentiation to find $ \frac{dy}{dx} $ given that $ x^3+4xy^2-7=y^3 $
