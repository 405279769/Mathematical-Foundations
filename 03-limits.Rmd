# Limits

Both concepts of differentiation and integration are based on the idea of limit.

## Introduction

**Problem 1** Suppose an object moves along the $x$-axis and its displacement $s$ in meters  at time $t$ in seconds is given by $$s(t)=t^2,~~~t\geq 0.$$
Find its velocity at time $t=2$.

*Solution* Velocity (or speed) is defined by 
$$\text{velocity}=\frac{\text{distance traveled}}{\text{time elapsed}}$$

**Problem 2** Find the area of the region that lies under the curve $y=x^2$ and above the $x$-axis for $x$ between $0$ and $1$.

*Solution*


## Limits of Sequences

## Limits of Functions at Infinity

## One-sided Limits

## Two-sided Limits

## Continunous Functions
