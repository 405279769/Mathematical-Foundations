## Sets

### Introduction

**Idea of definition**: A set is a collection of objects.

**Terminology** An object in a set is called an **element** or a member of the set. To describe sets, we can use *listing* or *description*.

**Listing** List all the elements in a set, e.g., $\{1,2,3\}$ is the set containing three elements.

**Description** Describe a common property of the elements of the set, using the
following notation:
$$\{x:P(x)\}~~~\text{or}~~~ \{x|p(x)\}$$ 
read "the set of all $x$ such that $P(x)$ (is true)". 
For example $\{x:x ~~\text{is a positive integer less than 101}\}=\{1,\ldots,100\}=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:x\le100\}$. 

**Notations**

1. The set of all real numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{R}$.

2. The set of all rational numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{Q}$.

3. The set of all integers  is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$.

4. The set of all positive integers is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_+$.

5. The set of all all natural numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{N}$.

**Example** $2\in\mathbb{N}, 2\in\mathbb{Q},\pi\in\mathbb{R},\pi\notin\mathbb{Q}$.

**Example** Let $A=\{1,2,\ldots,100\}$ and $B=\{2,3,4,5\}$. Then every element of set $B$ is also an element of set $A$. The equity means assigning a name to a set, i.e., the set $\{1,2,\ldots,100\}$ is denoted by $A$. Sometimes, we use the symbol $:=$. 

**Notation** Given an object $x$ and a set $A$, either $x$ is an element of $A$ denoted by $x\in A$ or $x$ is not an element of $A$ denoted by $x\notin A$.

**Definition** The set that has no element is called **the empty set** denoted by $\emptyset$.

**Definition** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$ and vice versa, then we say that $A$ and $B$ are equal, denotedby $A=B$. Otherwise, we say that $A$ and $B$ are unequal, denoted by $A\neq B$.

**Example** Let $A=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$ and let $B=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}_+: x ~~\text{is a prime number less than 10}\}$. Then we have $A\neq B$.

**Example** Let $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and let $B=\{1,3,2\}$. Then we have $A=B$.

**Definition** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, then we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$, denoted by $A\subseteq B$. Otherwise, we say that $A$ is not a subset of $B$, denoted by $A\nsubseteq B$.

**Note**

1. $A\subseteq A$

2. $A=B$ if and only if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$.

3. $A\nsubseteq B$ means that there is at least one element of $A$ that is not an element of $B$.

**Example** Let $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, $B=\{1,3,5\}$, $C=\{2,4,6\}$. 
Then we have $B\subseteq A$ and $C\nsubseteq A$.

### Set operations

**Definition** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.

1. The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cap B$, is the set whose elements are those belonging to both $A$ and $B$, that is 
$$A\cap B=\{x:x\in A ~~\text{and}~~x\in B\}.$$

2. The **union** of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cup B$, is the set whose elements are those belonging to either $A$ or $B$ or both $A$ and $B$, that is
$$A\cup B=\{x: x\in A ~~\text{or}~~x\in B\}.$$

**Example** Let $A=\{2,3,5\}$, $B=\{2,5,6,8\}$ and $C=\{1,2,3\}$. Find the following sets: $A\cap B$, $A\cup B$, $(A\cap B)\cap C$, $A\cap (B\cap C)$.

**Associative** Set intersection and set union are associative.
$$(A\cap B)\cap C=A\cap(B\cap C)$$
$$(A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup(B\cup C)$$

**Definition** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. The relative complement of $B$ in $A$, denoted by $A\backslash B$ or $A-B$, is the set whose elements are those belonging to $A$ but not belonging to $B$, that is,
$$A\backslash B=\{x\in A:x\notin B\}.$$

**Example** Let $A=\{a,b,c\}$ and $B=\{c,d,e\}$. Then we have $A\backslash B=\{a,b\}.$

**Universal set** A large enough set containing all objects under consideration, denoted by $U$.

**Example** In considering whole numbers, we may use $\mathbb{Z}$ as a universal set. The set of all prime numbers can be written as $\{x\in\mathbb{Z}:x>0 ~\text{and}~x~ \text{has exactly two divisors} \}$.

**Definition** Let $U$ be a universal set and let $B$ be a subset of $U$. Then the set $U\backslash B$ is called the complement of $B$ (in $U$) and is denoted by $B'$ (or $B^c$).


**Venn Diagrams** A Venn diagram is a device to represent sets graphically.

**Formulas for set operations**

$$(A\cup B)\cap C=(A\cap B)\cup(B\cap C)$$
