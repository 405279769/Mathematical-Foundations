(c) As you can see in the graphs, to the left of the equilibrium point, when P&lt;18, the demand curve is above the supply curve, there is excess demand. (d) When a fixed tax of $5 is imposed, the supply function is changed, the price in the supply function is reduced by 5 on each good, that is: \\[ Q_S = -50+10(P-5) \\\\ = -100+10P\\] \\[\\begin{cases} Q=400-15P\\\\ Q=-100+10P \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 0=(400-15P)-(-100+10P)\\\\ =500-25P \\] \\[ P=20 \\] \\[ Q=400-15P\\\\ =400-15\\times20\\\\ =100 \\] Thus, the new equilibrium price is 20 and the equilibrium quantity is 100. Question 3 (a) P and Q are negatively correlated in the demand equation; P and Q are positively correlated in the supply equation.Thus, the first equation represents the demand curve, and the second equation represents the supply curve. (b) In order to get the values of slope and vertical intercept, we transform the equation. \\[ Q+3P=48 \\] \\[ 3P=-Q+48 \\] \\[ P=-\\frac{Q}{3}+16 \\] Thus, the coefficient of Q is the slope, and when Q=0, the P value obtained is the vertical intercept.So for the demand curve, the slope is -1/3, the vertical intercept is 16. (c) \\[\\begin{cases} Q+3P=48\\\\ Q-2P=30 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 3P+2P=48-30 \\] \\[ 5P=18 \\] \\[ P=3.6 \\] Substitute P into one of the equation(we choose equation 1), we get: \\[ Q+3\\times3.6=48 \\] \\[ Q=37.2 \\] Thus, the equilibrium price is 3.6, the equilibrium quantity is 37.2. Question 4 (a) As \\[ Y=C+I+G \\] Substitute C,I,G into the function, we get: \\[ Y= (0.75Y_d+150)+100+250 \\\\ = [0.75(Y-T)+150]+100+250\\\\ = [0.75(Y-50)+150]+100+250\\\\ = 0.75Y-0.75\\times50+150+100+250\\] \\[ Y-0.75Y=-37.5+150+100+250\\] \\[ 0.25Y=462.5 \\] \\[ Y=1850 \\] Thus, the equilibrium level of national income is 1850. (b) \\[ Y = C+I+G\\\\ = (0.75Y_d+150)+(I+G)\\\\ = [0.75(Y-T)+150]+(I+G)\\\\ = 0.75Y-0.75T+150+(I+G)\\] \\[ 0.25Y = -0.75T+150+(I+G) \\] Substitute Y=1850+20=1870,T=50 into the function, we get: \\[ 0.25\\times1870 = -0.75\\times50+150+(I+G) \\] \\[ I+G = 355 \\] The total increase in G and I is 5 as follows. \\[ 355-(100+250)=5 \\] Question 5 (a) Substitute K=40,L=30 into the function, we get: \\[ Q = \\frac{KL}{K+2L}\\\\ = \\frac{40\\times30}{40+2\\times30}\\\\ = \\frac{1200}{100}\\\\ = 12\\] (b) Substitute Q=4,K=10 into the function, we get: \\[ 4 = \\frac{10L}{10+2L}\\] \\[ 40+8L = 10L \\] \\[ 40 = 2L \\] \\[ L=20 \\] (c) \\[ Q = \\frac{KL}{K+2L}\\] \\[ Q(K+2L)=KL \\] \\[ QK+2QL=KL \\] \\[ KL-QK=2QL \\] \\[ K(L-Q)=2QL \\] \\[ K=\\frac{2QL}{L-Q} \\] Question 6 (a) \\[ C+I=0.75Y+18+22\\\\ =0.75Y+40 \\] When Y=0, \\[ C+I = 0.75\\times0+40\\\\ =40 \\] When Y=100, \\[ C+I = 0.75\\times100+40\\\\ =115 \\] When Y=200, \\[ C+I = 0.75\\times200+40\\\\ =190 \\] The graphs are omitted, please refer to textbook answers(page 673 ). \\[ Y = C+I = 0.75Y+40 \\] \\[ 0.25Y=40 \\] \\[ Y=160 \\] Thus, the equilibrium level of national income is 160. The equilibrium level of national income decreases, you can refer to textbook answers(page 673 ). Question 7 (a) These goods are substitutable. As in the demand function for good 1, the coefficient of P2 is positive, which means that when the demand for good 1 rises, the price of good 2 increases so that the demand for good 2 decreases. It is the same in the demand function for good 2. (b) To get the equilibrium price and quantity,we use \\[ Q_D = Q_S\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 120-2P_1+P_2=-7+7P_1\\\\ 168+3P_1-7P_2=-3+20P_2 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=127\\\\ 3P_1-27P_2=-171 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=127\\\\ 3(3P_1-27P_2)=-171\\times3 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=127\\\\ 3(3P_1-27P_2)=-171\\times3 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[80P_2=640 \\] \\[ P_2 = 8 \\] Substitute the value into any equation (we choose equation 1) \\[ 120-2P_1+8 ==-7+7P_1 \\] \\[ P_1=15 \\] \\[ Q_1 = -7+7P_1\\\\ = -7+7\\times15\\\\ = 98 \\] \\[ Q_2 = -3+20P_2\\\\ = -3+20\\times8\\\\ = 157 \\] The equilibrium price and quantity for good 1 are 15 and 98;The equilibrium price and quantity for good 2 are 8 and 157. (c) As there is a subsidy of $4 on good 1, the subsidy have effect on the supply function, so \\[ P_1&#39; = P_1 + 4 \\] So \\[ Q_{D_1} = 120-2P_1+P_2 ; Q_{S2} = -7+7{P_1}&#39;\\\\ Q_{D_1} = 168+3P_1-7P_2 ; Q_{S2} = -3+20{P_2}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 120-2P_1+P_2=-7+7(P_1+4)\\\\ 168+3P_1-7P_2=-3+20P_2 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=99\\\\ 3P_1-27P_2=-171 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=99\\\\ 3(3P_1-27P_2)=-171\\times3 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[80P_2=612\\] \\[ P_2 = 7.65 \\] Substitute the value into any equation (we choose equation 1) \\[ 120-2P_1+P_2=-7+7(P_1+4) \\] \\[ 120-2P_1+7.65=-7+7(P_1+4) \\] \\[P_1 = 11.85 \\] \\[11.85-15=-3.15 \\\\ 7.65-8=-0.35 \\] For good 1, the equilibrium price reduces by $3.15;For good 2, the equilibrium price reduces by $0.35. Question 8 (a) \\[ 3f+4s \\leq 3000 \\] Substitute s=270 into the function, we get: \\[ 3f+4\\times270 \\leq 3000 \\] \\[ 3f \\leq 3000-4\\times270 \\] \\[ 3f\\leq 1920 \\] \\[ f \\leq 640 \\] Thus, the maximum amount of flour is 640kg. (b) (i)\\[ P=\\frac{36}{2Q+5}\\\\ =\\frac{36}{2\\times3.5+5}\\\\ =\\frac{36}{12}\\\\ =3 \\] (ii)\\[ P=2.4\\\\ =\\frac{36}{2Q+5}\\] \\[ 2.4(2Q+5)=36 \\] \\[ 4.8Q+12=36 \\] \\[ 4.8Q=24 \\] \\[ Q=5 \\] (iii)\\[ P=\\frac{36}{2Q+5} \\] \\[ P(2Q+5)=36 \\] \\[ 2PQ+5P=36 \\] \\[ 2PQ=36-5P \\] \\[ Q=\\frac{36-5P}{2P} \\] (c) As \\[ Y=C+S \\] \\[ S=Y-C\\\\ =Y-\\frac{Y^2 + 100}{Y+2}\\\\ =\\frac{Y(Y+2)-(Y^2 + 100)}{Y+2}\\\\ =\\frac{Y^2+2Y-Y^2-100}{Y+2}\\\\ =\\frac{2Y-100}{Y+2}\\] Question 9 (a) Firstly, we get x and y expressed by m and n. \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ 3x+my=n \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 3(2x+6y)=3\\\\ 2(3x+my)=2n \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[(18-2m)y=3-2n\\] \\[ y=\\frac{3-2n}{2(9-m)}\\] Substitute the value of y into any equation (we choose equation 1) \\[ 2x+6(\\frac{3-2n}{2(9-m)}) =1\\] \\[ x= \\frac{6n-m}{2(9-m)} \\] Thus, when m=9, the system fail to possess a unique solution. When m=9, \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ 3x+9y=n \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ \\frac{2}{3}(3x+9y)=\\frac{2}{3}n \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ 2x+3y=\\frac{2}{3}n\\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 0 = 1-\\frac{2}{3}n \\] When m=9, n = 1.5, the above equation(0=1-2/3n) exits, the two equations in the system of equations are equivalent, so the system has infinite solutions;When\\[ m=9, n \\neq1.5\\], the above equation(0=1-2/3n) doesn‚Äôt exit, the system doesn‚Äôt have any solution.

As the MPC decreases, the slope of the function(C = 0.6Y+60) decreases, we assume it decreases to be a, then a&lt;0.6 .
