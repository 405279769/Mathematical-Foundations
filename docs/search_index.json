Then we have \\((a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2\\) \\((a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2\\) \\((a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2\\) Solving Linear Equations Definition A solution to \\(F(x)=0\\) is a real number \\(x_0\\) such that \\(F(x_0)=0\\). Definition We say that two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution(s). Solving Quadratic Equations A quadratic equation (in one unknown) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[ax^2+bx+c=0\\] where \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants and \\(a\\neq0\\). To solve this equations, we can use the Factorization Method or the Quadratic Formula. Quadratic Formula Solutions to Equation \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\) are given by \\[x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\\] \\(b^2‚àí4ac\\) is called the discriminant Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem Remainder Theorem If a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) is divided by \\(x‚àíc\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant, the remainder is \\(p(c)\\). Factor Theorem \\((x‚àíc)\\) is a factor of a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) if and only if \\(p(c)=0\\). Solving Linear Inequalities Definition A solution to an inequality \\(F(x)&lt;0\\) is a real number \\(x_0\\) such that \\(F(x0)&lt;0\\). The definition also applies to other types of inequalities. Rules for Inequalities Let \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) be real numbers. Then the following holds. If \\(a&lt;b\\), then \\(a+c&lt;b+c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c&gt;0\\), then \\(ac&lt;bc\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c&lt;0\\), then \\(ac&gt;bc\\). Note: The inequality is reversed. If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(b‚â§c\\), then \\(a&lt;c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have the same sign, then \\(\\frac{1}{a}&gt;\\frac{1}{b}\\). Lines A line equation in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[ax+by+c=0\\] where \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants with \\(a,b\\) not both \\(0\\). More generally, an equation in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[F(x,y)=0\\] where \\(F\\) is a function (from a collection of ordered pairs into \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)). Definition An ordered pair (of real numbers) is a pair of real numbers \\(x_0\\), \\(y_0\\) enclosed in side parenthesis: \\((x_0,y_0)\\). Definition A solution to Equation (??) is an ordered pair \\((x_0,y_0)\\) such that \\(F(x_0,y_0)=0\\). Rectangular Coordinate System Given a plane, there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in the plane and ordered pairs of real numbers. The plane described in this way is called the Cartesian plane or the rectangular coordinate plane. The \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes divide the (rectangular) coordinate plane into 4 regions (called quadrants): Quadrant I = \\(\\{(a;b):a&gt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&gt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant II = \\(\\{(a;b):a&lt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&gt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant III = \\(\\{(a;b):a&lt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&lt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant IV = \\(\\{(a;b):a&gt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&lt;0 \\}\\); Lines in the Coordinate Plane Consider the following equation \\[\\begin{equation} Ax+By+C=0 \\tag{0.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(A,B\\) and \\(C\\) are constants with \\(A,B\\) not both zero. It is not difficult to see that the equation has infinitely many solutions. Each solution \\((x_0,y_0)\\) represents a point in the (rectangular) coordinate plane. The collection of all solutions (points) form a line, called the graph of Equation (0.1). Definition For a non-vertical line \\(l\\), its slope (denoted by \\(m\\)) is defined to be \\[m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\] where \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) are any two distinct points lying on the line. Equations for Lines Let \\(l\\) be a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane. Suppose \\((x_1,y_1)\\) is a point lying on \\(l\\) and \\(m\\) is the slope. Then an equation for \\(l\\) can be written in the form \\[y‚àíy_1=m(x‚àíx_1)\\] called a point-slope form for \\(l\\). Suppose the \\(y\\)-intercept of \\(l\\) is \\((0,b)\\) and the slope of \\(l\\) is \\(m\\). Then a point-slope form for \\(l\\) is \\[y‚àíb=m(x‚àí0)\\] which can be written as \\[y=mx+b\\] called the slope-intercept form for \\(l\\). Parallel and Perpendicular Lines Let \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) be (non-vertical) lines with slopes \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) respectively. Then \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) are parallel if and only if \\(m_1=m_2\\). \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) are perpendicular to each other if and only if \\(m_1\\cdot m_2=-1\\). Pythagoras Theorem, Distance Formula and Circles Pythagoras Theorem Let \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) be the (lengths of the) sides of a right-angled triangle where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.Then we have \\[a^2+b^2=c^2\\] Distance Formula Let \\(P=(x1,y1)\\) and \\(Q=(x2,y2)\\). Then the distance \\(PQ\\) between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is \\[PQ=(x_2‚àíx_1)^2+(y_2‚àíy_1)^2\\] Equation of Circles Let \\(C\\) be the circle with center at \\((h,k)\\) and radius \\(r\\). Then an equation for \\(C\\) is \\[(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2\\] Parabola The graph of \\[y=ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\neq 0\\), is a parabola. The parabola intersects the \\(x\\)-axis at two distinct points if \\(b^2‚àí4ac&gt;0\\). It touches the \\(x\\)-axis (one intersection point only) if \\(b^2‚àí4ac=0\\) and does not intersect the \\(x\\)-axis if \\(b^2‚àí4ac&lt;0\\). If \\(a&gt;0\\), the parabola opens upward and there is a lowest point (called the vertex of the parabola). If \\(a&lt;0\\), the parabola opens downward and there is a highest point (vertex). The vertical line that passes through the vertex is called the axis of symmetry because the parabola is symmetric about this line. Systems of Equations A system of two equations in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be written as \\[ \\begin{cases} F_1(x,y)=0\\\\ F_2(x,y)=0 \\end{cases} \\] Usually, each equation represents a curve in the coordinate plane. Solving the system means to find all ordered pairs \\((x_0,y_0)\\) such that \\(F_1(x_0,y_0)=0\\) and \\(F_2(x_0,y_0)=0\\), that is, to find all points \\((x_0,y_0)\\) that lies on the intersection of the two curves. To solve a system of two linear equations (with two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) \\[ \\begin{cases} ax+by+c=0\\\\ dx+ey+f=0 \\end{cases} \\] we can use elimination or substitution. "],["sets-real-numbers-and-inequalities.html", "1 Sets, Real Numbers and Inequalities 1.1 Sets 1.2 Real Numbers 1.3 Solving Inequalities", " 1 Sets, Real Numbers and Inequalities 1.1 Sets 1.1.1 Introduction Idea of definition: A set is a collection of objects. Terminology An object in a set is called an element or a member of the set. To describe sets, we can use listing or description. Listing List all the elements in a set, e.g., \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) is the set containing three elements. Description Describe a common property of the elements of the set, using the following notation: \\[\\{x:P(x)\\}~~~\\text{or}~~~ \\{x|p(x)\\}\\] read ‚Äúthe set of all \\(x\\) such that \\(P(x)\\) (is true)‚Äù. For example \\(\\{x:x ~~\\text{is a positive integer less than 101}\\}=\\{1,\\ldots,100\\}=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:x\\le100\\}\\). Notations The set of all real numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The set of all rational numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The set of all integers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). The set of all positive integers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}_+\\). The set of all all natural numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Example \\(2\\in\\mathbb{N}, 2\\in\\mathbb{Q},\\pi\\in\\mathbb{R},\\pi\\notin\\mathbb{Q}\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,2,\\ldots,100\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{2,3,4,5\\}\\). Then every element of set \\(B\\) is also an element of set \\(A\\). The equity means assigning a name to a set, i.e., the set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,100\\}\\) is denoted by \\(A\\). Sometimes, we use the symbol \\(:=\\). Notation Given an object \\(x\\) and a set \\(A\\), either \\(x\\) is an element of \\(A\\) denoted by \\(x\\in A\\) or \\(x\\) is not an element of \\(A\\) denoted by \\(x\\notin A\\). Definition The set that has no element is called the empty set denoted by \\(\\emptyset\\). Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. If every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\) and vice versa, then we say that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal, denotedby \\(A=B\\). Otherwise, we say that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are unequal, denoted by \\(A\\neq B\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}\\) and let \\(B=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+: x ~~\\text{is a prime number less than 10}\\}\\). Then we have \\(A\\neq B\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and let \\(B=\\{1,3,2\\}\\). Then we have \\(A=B\\). Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. If every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\), then we say that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\subseteq B\\). Otherwise, we say that \\(A\\) is not a subset of \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\nsubseteq B\\). Note \\(A\\subseteq A\\) \\(A=B\\) if and only if \\(A\\subseteq B\\) and \\(B\\subseteq A\\). \\(A\\nsubseteq B\\) means that there is at least one element of \\(A\\) that is not an element of \\(B\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), \\(B=\\{1,3,5\\}\\), \\(C=\\{2,4,6\\}\\). Then we have \\(B\\subseteq A\\) and \\(C\\nsubseteq A\\). 1.1.2 Set operations Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. The intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\cap B\\), is the set whose elements are those belonging to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that is \\[A\\cap B=\\{x:x\\in A ~~\\text{and}~~x\\in B\\}.\\] The union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\cup B\\), is the set whose elements are those belonging to either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) or both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that is \\[A\\cup B=\\{x: x\\in A ~~\\text{or}~~x\\in B\\}.\\] Example Let \\(A=\\{2,3,5\\}\\), \\(B=\\{2,5,6,8\\}\\) and \\(C=\\{1,2,3\\}\\). Find the following sets: \\(A\\cap B\\), \\(A\\cup B\\), \\((A\\cap B)\\cap C\\), \\(A\\cap (B\\cap C)\\). Associative Set intersection and set union are associative. \\[(A\\cap B)\\cap C=A\\cap(B\\cap C)\\] \\[(A\\cup B)\\cup C=A\\cup(B\\cup C)\\] Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. The relative complement of \\(B\\) in \\(A\\), denoted by \\(A\\backslash B\\) or \\(A-B\\), is the set whose elements are those belonging to \\(A\\) but not belonging to \\(B\\), that is, \\[A\\backslash B=\\{x\\in A:x\\notin B\\}.\\] Example Let \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{c,d,e\\}\\). Then we have \\(A\\backslash B=\\{a,b\\}.\\) Universal set A large enough set containing all objects under consideration, denoted by \\(U\\). Example In considering whole numbers, we may use \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) as a universal set. The set of all prime numbers can be written as \\(\\{x\\in\\mathbb{Z}:x&gt;0 ~\\text{and}~x~ \\text{has exactly two divisors} \\}\\). Definition Let \\(U\\) be a universal set and let \\(B\\) be a subset of \\(U\\). Then the set \\(U\\backslash B\\) is called the complement of \\(B\\) (in \\(U\\)) and is denoted by \\(B&#39;\\) (or \\(B^c\\)). Venn Diagrams A Venn diagram is a device to represent sets graphically. Formulas for set operations \\[(A\\cup B)\\cap C=(A\\cap B)\\cup(B\\cap C)\\] 1.2 Real Numbers 1.2.1 The Number Systems Natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) Integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}=\\{\\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) Rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}=\\{\\frac{p}{q}:p,q~~ \\text{are integers, and}~~q\\neq 0\\}.\\) \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}.\\) Irrational numbers Numbers that can be represented by non-terminating and non-repeating decimals. For example \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). Real numbers Rational numbers together with irrational numbers are called real numbers, denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Real number line Real numbers can be represented by points on a line, called the real number line. Intervals The following types of subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) are called intervals \\[[a,b]=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:a\\le x\\le b\\}\\] \\[(a,b)=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:a&lt; x&lt; b\\}\\] \\[[a,b)=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:a\\le x&lt; b\\}\\] \\[(a,b]=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:a&lt; x\\le b\\}\\] \\[[a,\\infty)=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:a\\le x\\}\\] \\[(a,\\infty)=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:a&lt; x\\}\\] \\[(\\infty,b]=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:x\\le b\\}\\] \\[(\\infty,b)=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:x&lt; b\\}\\] \\[(-\\infty,\\infty)=\\mathbb{R}\\] Terminology Bounded intervals: \\([a,b],(a,b),(a,b],[a,b)\\) Unbouded intervals: \\((-\\infty,b),(-\\infty,b],(a,\\infty),[a,\\infty),(-\\infty,\\infty)\\) Open intervals: \\((a,b),(-\\infty,b),(a,\\infty),(-\\infty,\\infty)\\) Closed intervals: \\([a,b],(\\infty,b],[a,\\infty),(-\\infty,\\infty)\\) Closed and bounded intervals: \\([a,b]\\) Degenerated interval: An interval containing only one element of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). For example \\(\\{a\\}\\). Empty interval: \\(\\emptyset\\). Example \\(A=[1,5]\\) and \\(B=(3,10]\\). Find \\(A\\cap B\\) and \\(A\\cup B\\). 1.2.2 Radicals Root Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be real numbers and let \\(q\\) be a positive integer. If \\(a^q=b\\), we say that \\(a\\) is a \\(q\\)th root of \\(b\\). Example \\(-2\\) is the cube root of \\(-8\\). \\(3\\) and \\(-3\\) are the square roots of \\(9\\). Note If \\(q\\) is odd, then every real number has a unique \\(q\\)th root. If \\(q\\) is even, then every positive real number has two \\(q\\)th roots; negative real numbers do not have \\(q\\)th root; the \\(q\\)th root of \\(0\\) is \\(0\\). Principal root Denoted by \\(\\sqrt[q]{b}\\). If \\(q\\) is odd, \\(\\sqrt[q]{b}\\) is the \\(q\\)th root of \\(b\\). If \\(q\\) is even, If \\(b&gt;0\\), \\(\\sqrt[q]{b}\\) is the positive \\(q\\)th root of \\(b\\). If \\(b&lt;0\\), the principal root is undefined. If \\(b=0\\), \\(\\sqrt[q]{b}=0\\). Terminology The symbol \\(\\sqrt[q]{b}\\) is called a radical, in which \\(q\\) is called the index and b the radicand. Formula \\(b^{\\frac{p}{q}}=\\sqrt[q]{b^p}\\). 1.3 Solving Inequalities An inequality in one unknown \\(x\\) can be written in one of the following forms: \\(F(x)&gt;0\\) \\(F(x)\\geq0\\) \\(F(x)&lt;0\\) \\(F(x)\\le 0\\) Definition Consider an inequality in the form \\(F(x)&gt;0\\). A real number \\(x_0\\) satisfying \\(F(x_0)&gt;0\\) is caleed a solution to the inequality. The set of all solutions to the inequality is called the solution set to the inequality. Polynomial inequalities have a liking form of \\(a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_0&lt;0\\). Note that when \\(n=1\\) it is a linear inequality. Example Find the solution set to \\(1\\le3-2x\\le9.\\) Find the solution set to \\(2x+1&lt;3\\) and \\(3x+10&lt;4\\). Quadratic inequalities Example: Find the solution set to the inequality \\(x^2+2x-15&gt;0\\). Polynomial inequality with degrees \\(\\geq 3\\) Example: Factorize the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^3+3x^2-4x-12\\) and find the solution set to \\(p(x)\\le0\\). Theorem Let \\[p(x)=c_nx^n+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+c_1x+c_0\\] be a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) where \\(c_0,c_1,\\ldots,c_n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\). Suppose \\((ax-b)\\) is a factor of \\(p(x)\\) where \\(a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\). Then \\(a\\) divides \\(c_n\\) and \\(b\\) divides \\(c_0\\).

A function from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), denoted by \\(f:A\\rightarrowB\\), is a rule that assigns to each element of \\(A\\) exactly one element of \\(B\\). Terminology The sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are called the domain and codomain of \\(f\\), respectively. The domain is denoted by \\(\\text{dom}(f)\\). Terminology For each \\(x\\) in \\(A\\), the corresponding element assigned by \\(f\\) is denoted by \\(f(x)\\) and is called the image of \\(x\\) under \\(f\\). Terminology The input variable for a function is called an independent variable. The output variable is called a dependent variable because its value depends on the value of the independent variable. Example \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R},~x\\mapsto f(x)=x^2+2\\). 2.2 Domains and Ranges Natural domain The natural domain of \\(f\\) is the set of all real numbers \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x)\\) is defined. Example Find the (natural) domains of the following functions: \\(g(x)=\\frac{1}{x-2}\\) \\(h(x)=\\sqrt{1+5x}\\) Definition Let \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) be a function and let \\(S\\subseteq A\\). The image of \\(S\\) under \\(f\\), denoted by \\(f[S]\\), is the subset of \\(B\\) given by the subset of \\(B\\) consisting of all the images under \\(f\\) of elements in \\(S\\): \\[f[S]=\\{y\\in B:y=f(x)~~\\text{for some}~~x\\in S\\}.\\] Example Let \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, x\\mapsto f(x)=x^2\\). For \\(S=\\{1,2,3\\}\\), we have \\(f[S]=\\{1,4,9\\}\\). Definition Let \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) be a function. The range of \\(f\\), denoted by \\(\\text{ran}(f)\\), is the image of \\(A\\) under \\(f\\), that is, \\(\\text{ran}(f)=f[A]\\). Example Let \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, x\\mapsto f(x)=x^2+2\\). Then \\(3\\) and \\(2\\) belongs to the range of \\(f\\) but \\(1\\) does not belong to the range of \\(f\\). Steps to find range of function Put \\(y=f(x)\\). Solve \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\). The range of \\(f\\) is the set of all real numbers \\(y\\) such that \\(x\\) can be solved. Example Find the ranges of the following functions: \\(f(x)=x^2+2\\) \\(g(x)=\\frac{1}{x-2}\\) \\(h(x)=\\sqrt{1+5x}\\) \\(l(x)=\\frac{2x+1}{x^2+1}\\) 2.3 Graphs of Equations Ordered pair of real numbers An ordered pair of real numbers represents a point in the coordinate plane. The set of all ordered pairs \\((x_0,y_0)\\) is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), i.e., \\((x_0,y_0)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\). So the plane is also denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Functions of two variables \\(f:A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R},(x,y)\\in A\\mapsto f((x,y))\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Note that \\(f((x,y))\\) is normally simplified as \\(f(x,y)\\). Example \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}, (x,y)\\mapsto f(x,y)=x+y^2.\\) Graph of a function Let \\(F\\) be a function of two variables \\((x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\mapsto F(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Consider an equation in the form of \\(F(x,y)=0\\). The set of all ordered pairs \\((x,y)\\) satisfying \\(F(x,y)=0\\) is called the graph of the equation \\(F(x,y)=0\\), i.e., it is a subset of the plane \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\): \\[\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2:F(x,y)=0\\}.\\] Definition An \\(x\\)-intercept (\\(y\\)-intercept) of the graph of an equation \\(F(x,y)=0\\) is a point where the graph intersects the \\(x\\)-axis (\\(y\\)-axis). Example The graph of equation \\(x^2+y^2=1\\) is a circle with two \\(x\\)-intercepts \\((1,0),(-1,0)\\) and two \\(y\\)-intercepts \\((0,1),(0,-1)\\). Symmetry Consider the graph of the equation \\(y=x^2\\). The graph is a parabola. If \\((a,b)\\) is a point belonging to the parabola, then \\((-a,b)\\) also belongs to the parabola since \\(b=(-a)^2\\). We say that the parabola is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis. Symmetry In general, a subset \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) of the plane \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) is said to be symmetric about a line \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) if the following condition is satisfied: For any point \\(P\\) belonging to \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), there is a point \\(Q\\) belonging to \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) such that the line segment \\(PQ\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\mathcal{L}\\); \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are equidistant from \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). 2.4 Graphs of Functions Let \\(f:A\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) be a function where \\(A\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\). The graph of \\(f\\) is the following subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\): \\[\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2:x\\in A~~\\text{and}~~y=f(x)\\}.\\] Constant functions \\(f(x)=c\\). The domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The range is a singleton \\(\\{c\\}\\). Figure 2.1: Constant function Linear functions \\(f(x)=ax+b\\). The domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The range is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Figure 2.2: Linear function Quadratic functions \\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\\). The domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The range is \\([k,\\infty)\\) if \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\((-\\infty,k]\\) if \\(a&lt;0\\), where \\(k\\) is the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex. Figure 2.3: Quadratic function Polynomial functions with degree \\(n\\) \\(f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1x+a_0\\). The domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). There are three possibilities for the range. If the degree \\(n\\) is odd, then \\(\\text{ran}(f)=\\mathbb{R}\\). If the degree \\(n\\) is even and positive, then If \\(a_n&gt;0\\) \\(\\text{ran}(f)=[k,\\infty)\\); If \\(a_n&lt;0\\) \\(\\text{ran}(f)=(\\infty,k]\\). Example \\(f(x)=x^3-3x^2+x-1.\\) Figure 2.4: Polynomial function Rational functions are in the form of \\[f(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)},\\] where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are polynomial functions. Example \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}\\). The domain of \\(f\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\backslash \\{0\\}\\). The range of \\(f\\) is also \\(\\mathbb{R}\\backslash \\{0\\}\\). The graph of it is symmetric about the origin because \\(f(-x)=-f(x)\\). Figure 2.5: Rational function Principle-square-root function. Denoted by sqrt or \\(\\sqrt{~~}\\). Given by \\(\\text{sqrt}(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). The domain is \\([0,\\infty)\\). The range is \\([0,\\infty)\\). Figure 2.6: Square-root function Example For each of the following equations, sketch its graph. \\(y=\\sqrt{x}-2\\) Figure 2.7: Square-root function \\(y=\\sqrt{x-2}\\) Figure 2.8: Square-root function \\(y=\\sqrt{2-x}\\) Figure 2.9: Square-root function Remark Let \\(a\\) be a positive constant. The graph of \\(y=f(x)+a\\) can be obtained from that of \\(y=f(x)\\) by moving it \\(a\\) units up. The graph of \\(y=f(x)-a\\) can be obtained from that of \\(y=f(x)\\) by moving it \\(a\\) units down The graph of \\(y=f(x+a)\\) can be obtained from that of \\(y=f(x)\\) by moving it \\(a\\) units to the left. The graph of \\(y=f(x-a)\\) can be obtained from that of \\(y=f(x)\\) by moving it \\(a\\) units to the right. The graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{2-x}\\) and that of \\(y=\\sqrt{x-2}\\) are symmetric w.r.t. the vertical line \\(x=2\\). Exponential functions with base \\(b\\) is given by \\[\\exp_b(x)=b^x\\]. The domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The range is \\((0,\\infty)\\). The \\(y\\)-intercept of the graph of every exponential function is \\((0,1)\\). Example The graph of \\(\\exp_2\\) goes up and the rate that the graph goes up increases as \\(x\\) increases. Figure 2.10: Exponential function with base larger than 1 Example The graph of \\(\\exp_{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) goes down as \\(x\\) increases. Figure 2.11: Exponential function with base smaller than 1 Logarithmic functions. The function, denoted by \\(\\log\\), is called the common logarithmic function. For each positive real number \\(x\\), \\(\\log(x)\\) is defined to be the unique real number such that \\(10^{\\log (x)}=x\\). That is, \\(\\log(x)=y\\) if and only if \\(y=10^x\\). The domain of log is \\((0,\\infty)\\). The range is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Figure 2.12: Logarithmic function Absolute value function, denoted by \\(|\\cdot|\\), is the function from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), given by \\[\\begin{equation} |x|= \\begin{cases} x~~&amp;\\text{if}~~ x&gt;0,\\\\ 0~~&amp;\\text{if}~~ x=0,\\\\ -x~~&amp;\\text{if}~~x&lt;0. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] In defining \\(|x|\\), the domain \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is divided into three disjoint subsets, namely \\((0,\\infty)\\), \\(\\{0\\}\\) and \\((-\\infty,0)\\). Functions defined in this way are called piecewise-defined functions. Figure 2.13: Absolute value function Piecewise-defined functions Example Let \\(f:[-2,6]\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R},x\\mapsto f(x)\\) be the function given by \\[\\begin{equation} f(x)= \\begin{cases} x^2~~&amp;\\text{if}~~-2\\le x&lt;0\\\\ 2x~~&amp;\\text{if}~~0\\le x&lt;2\\\\ 4-x~~&amp;\\text{if}~~2\\le x\\le 6 \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 2.14: Piecewise function Step function Suppose the long-distance rate for a telephone call from City A to City B is $1.4 for the first minute and $0.9 for each additional minute or fraction thereof. If \\(y=f(t)\\) is a function that indicates the total charge \\(y\\) for a call of \\(t\\) minutes‚Äô duration, sketch the graph of \\(f\\) for \\(0&lt;t\\le 4\\frac{1}{2}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} f(t)= \\begin{cases} 1.4 ~~&amp;\\text{if}~~0&lt;t\\le 1,\\\\ 2.3 ~~&amp;\\text{if}~~1&lt;t\\le 2,\\\\ 3.2 ~~&amp;\\text{if}~~2&lt;t\\le 3,\\\\ 4.1 ~~&amp;\\text{if}~~3&lt;t\\le 4,\\\\ 5.0 ~~&amp;\\text{if}~~4&lt;t\\le 4\\frac{1}{2}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 2.15: Step function 2.5 Compositions of Functions Definition Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be functions such that the codomain of \\(f\\) is a subset of the domain of \\(g\\). The composition of \\(g\\) with \\(f\\), denoted by \\((g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x)).\\) Example Let \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and \\(g(x)=2x+1\\). Find \\((f\\circ g)(x)\\) and \\((g\\circ f)(x)\\). Remark The composition of functions is not commutative. Remark If the range of \\(f\\) is not contained in the domain of \\(g\\), then we have to restrict \\(f\\) to a smaller set so that for every \\(x\\) in that set, \\(f(x)\\) belongs to the domain of \\(g\\). The domain of \\(g\\circ f\\) is taken to be the following: \\[\\text{dom}(g\\circ f)=\\{x\\in\\text{dom}(f):f(x)\\in\\text{dom}(g)\\}.\\] Example Let \\(f(x)=x+1\\) and \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). Find the domain of \\(g\\circ f\\). 2.6 Inverse Functions Definition Let \\(f\\) be a function. We say that \\(f\\) is injective if the following condition is satisfied: \\[x_1,x_2\\in\\text{dom}(f)~~\\text{and}~~ x_1\\neq x_2 \\implies f(x_1)\\neq f(x_2)\\] which is also equivalent to \\[x_1,x_2\\in\\text{dom}(f)~~\\text{and}~~ f(x_1)=f(x_2) \\implies x_1=x_2.\\] Example Let \\(g(x)=x^2\\). The domain of \\(g\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The function \\(g\\) is not injective. Horizontal line test Let \\(f: X\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) be a function where \\(X\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}\\). Then \\(f\\) is injective if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph of \\(f\\) in at most one point. Figure 2.16: Horizontal line test Definition Let \\(f: X\\rightarrow Y\\) be an injective function and let \\(Y_1\\) be the range of \\(f\\). The inverse function of \\(f\\), denoted by \\(f^{-1}\\), is the function from \\(Y_1\\) to \\(X\\) such that for every \\(y\\in Y_1\\), \\(f^{-1}(y)\\) is the unique element of \\(X\\) satisfying \\(f(f^{-1}(y))=y\\). Figure 2.17: Injective mapping Remark For every \\(x\\in X\\), we have \\((f^{-1}\\circ f)(x)=x.\\) For every \\(y\\in Y\\), we have \\((f\\circ f^{-1})(y)=y\\). \\(f^{-1}\\) is injective and \\((f^{-1})^{-1}(x)=f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\in\\text{dom}(f).\\) Steps to find inverse functions Put \\(y=f(x)\\). Solve \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\). The result will be in the form \\(x=\\) an expression in \\(y\\). From the expression in \\(y\\) obtained in step 2, the range of \\(f\\) can be determined. This is the domain of \\(f^{-1}\\). The required formula \\(f^{-1}(y)=\\) the expression in \\(y\\) obtained in Step 2. Example Let \\(f(x)=2x^3+1\\). Find the inverse of \\(f\\). Example Let \\(g: [0,\\infty)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, x\\mapsto g(x)=x^2\\). Find the inverse of \\(g\\). Graph of the inverse function The graph of \\(f\\) and the graph of \\(f^{-1}\\) are symmetric about the line \\(y=x\\). Figure 2.18: Inverse function 2.7 More on Solving Equations In this section, we will consider fractional equations and radical equations. In solving equations, if there is a one-sided implication \\(\\implies\\) in any one of the step, we have to check solution. Example For the following equations, find their solution sets, respectively. \\(\\frac{x}{x-1}+\\frac{2}{x}=\\frac{1}{x^2-x}\\) \\(\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{x-3}=3\\) Remark \\(a=b\\implies ac=bc\\), but the converse is true only if \\(c\\neq 0\\). \\(a=b \\implies a^2=b^2\\), but the converse is true only if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have the same sign.
