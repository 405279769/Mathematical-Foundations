Definition We say that two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution(s). 1.3.3 Solving quadratic equations A quadratic equation (in one unknown) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[ax^2+bx+c=0\\] where \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants and \\(a\\neq0\\). To solve this equations, we can use the Factorization Method or the Quadratic Formula. Quadratic Formula Solutions to Equation \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\) are given by \\[x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\\] \\(b^24ac\\) is called the discriminant 1.3.4 Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem Remainder Theorem If a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) is divided by \\(xc\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant, the remainder is \\(p(c)\\). Factor Theorem \\((xc)\\) is a factor of a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) if and only if \\(p(c)=0\\). 1.3.5 Solving Linear Inequalities Definition A solution to an inequality \\(F(x)&lt;0\\) is a real number \\(x_0\\) such that \\(F(x0)&lt;0\\). The definition also applies to other types of inequalities. Rules for Inequalities Let \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) be real numbers. Then the following holds. If \\(a&lt;b\\), then \\(a+c&lt;b+c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c&gt;0\\), then \\(ac&lt;bc\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c&lt;0\\), then \\(ac&gt;bc\\). Note: The inequality is reversed. If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(bc\\), then \\(a&lt;c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have the same sign, then \\(\\frac{1}{a}&gt;\\frac{1}{b}\\). 1.3.6 Lines A line equation in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[ax+by+c=0\\] where \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants with \\(a,b\\) not both \\(0\\). More generally, an equation in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[F(x,y)=0\\] where \\(F\\) is a function (from a collection of ordered pairs into \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)). Definition An ordered pair (of real numbers) is a pair of real numbers \\(x_0\\), \\(y_0\\) enclosed in side parenthesis: \\((x_0,y_0)\\). Definition A solution to Equation (??) is an ordered pair \\((x_0,y_0)\\) such that \\(F(x_0,y_0)=0\\). Rectangular Coordinate System Given a plane, there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in the plane and ordered pairs of real numbers. The plane described in this way is called the Cartesian plane or the rectangular coordinate plane. The x- and y-axes divide the (rectangular) coordinate plane into 4 regions (called quadrants): Quadrant I = \\(\\{(a;b):a&gt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&gt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant II = \\(\\{(a;b):a&lt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&gt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant III = \\(\\{(a;b):a&lt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&lt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant IV = \\(\\{(a;b):a&gt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&lt;0 \\}\\); Lines in the Coordinate Plane Consider the following equation \\[Ax+By+C=0\\] where \\(A,B\\) and \\(C\\) are constants with \\(A,B\\) not both zero. It is not difficult to see that the equation has infinitely many solutions. Each solution \\((x_0,y_0)\\) represents a point in the (rectangular) coordinate plane. The collection of all solutions (points) form a line, called the graph of Equation (??). Definition For a non-vertical line \\(l\\), its slope (denoted by \\(m\\)) is defined to be \\[m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\] where \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) are any two distinct points lying on the line. Equations for Lines Let \\(l\\) be a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane. Suppose \\((x_1,y_1)\\) is a point lying on \\(l\\) and \\(m\\) is the slope. Then an equation for \\(l\\) can be written in the form \\[yy_1=m(xx_1)\\] called a point-slope form for \\(l\\). Suppose the \\(y\\)-intercept of \\(l\\) is \\((0,b)\\) and the slope of \\(l\\) is \\(m\\). Then a point-slope form for \\(l\\) is \\[yb=m(x0)\\] which can be written as \\[y=mx+b\\] called the slope-intercept form for \\(l\\). Parallel and Perpendicular Lines Let \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) be (non-vertical) lines with slopes \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) respectively. Then \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) are parallel if and only if \\(m_1=m_2\\). \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) are perpendicular to each other if and only if \\(m_1\\cdot m_2=-1\\). 1.3.7 Pythagoras Theorem, Distance Formula and Circles Pythagoras Theorem Let \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) be the (lengths of the) sides of a right-angled triangle where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.Then we have \\[a^2+b^2=c^2\\] Distance Formula Let \\(P=(x1,y1)\\) and \\(Q=(x2,y2)\\). Then the distance \\(PQ\\) between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is \\(PQ=(x_2x_1)^2+(y_2y_1)^2\\) Equation of Circles Let \\(C\\) be the circle with center at \\((h,k)\\) and radius \\(r\\). Then an equation for \\(C\\) is \\[(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2\\] 1.3.8 Parabola The graph of \\[y=ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\neq 0\\), is a parabola. The parabola intersects the \\(x\\)-axis at two distinct points if \\(b^24ac&gt;0\\). It touches the \\(x\\)-axis (one intersection point only) if \\(b^24ac=0\\) and does not intersect the \\(x\\)-axis if \\(b^24ac&lt;0\\). If \\(a&gt;0\\), the parabola opens upward and there is a lowest point (called the vertex of the parabola). If \\(a&lt;0\\), the parabola opens downward and there is a highest point (vertex). The vertical line that passes through the vertex is called the axis of symmetry because the parabola is symmetric about this line. 1.3.9 Systems of equations A system of two equations in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be written as \\[ \\begin{cases} F_1(x,y)=0\\\\ F_2(x,y)=0 \\end{cases} \\] Usually, each equation represents a curve in the coordinate plane. Solving the system means to find all ordered pairs \\((x_0,y_0)\\) such that \\(F_1(x_0,y_0)=0\\) and \\(F_2(x_0,y_0)=0\\), that is, to find all points \\((x_0,y_0)\\) that lies on the intersection of the two curves. To solve a system of two linear equations (with two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) \\[ \\begin{cases} ax+by+c=0\\\\ dx+ey+f=0 \\end{cases} \\] we can use elimination or substitution. 1.4 Linear programming Feasible region The set of points which satisfy all of the constraints in a linear programming problem.

Non-negativity constraints The constraints \\(x  0, y  0\\), etc. Unbounded region A feasible region that is not completely enclosed by a polygon.

For any point \\(Q\\) on \\(C\\) with \\(Q\\neq P\\), its \\(x\\)-coordinate can be written as \\(x_0+h\\) where \\(h\\neq 0\\) (if \\(h&gt;0\\), \\(Q\\) is on the right of \\(P\\); if \\(h&lt;0\\), Q is on the left of \\(P\\)). Thus, \\(Q\\) can be written as \\((x_0+h;f(x_0+h))\\). The slope \\(m_{PQ}\\) of the secant line \\(PQ\\) is \\[m_{PQ}=\\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{(x_0+h)-x_0}=\\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}\\] Note that as \\(Q\\) approaches \\(P\\), the number \\(h\\) approaches \\(0\\). From these, we see that the slope of \\(C\\) at \\(P\\) (denoted by \\(m_p\\)) is \\[\\begin{equation} m_p=\\underset{h\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\lim}\\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] provided that the limit exists. Example Find the slope of the curve \\(y=x^2\\) at the point \\(P(3,9)\\). Definition Let \\(x_0\\) be a real number and let \\(f\\) be a function defined on an open interval containing \\(x_0\\). Suppose the limit in (3.1) exists. Then we say that \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x_0\\). Example Let \\(f(x)=|x|\\). The domain of \\(f\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The function \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(0\\). However it is not differentiable at \\(0\\). Definition Let \\(f\\) be a function that is differentiable at some points belonging in its domain.

Area under a curve Find the area of the region that lies under the curve \\(y=x^2\\) and above the \\(x\\)-axis for \\(x\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). First we divide the interval \\([0,1]\\) into finitely many sub-intervals of equal lengths: \\[\\left[0,\\frac{1}{n}\\right],\\left[\\frac{1}{n},\\frac{2}{n}\\right],\\ldots,\\left[\\frac{n-1}{n},1\\right].\\] For each sub-interval \\(\\left[\\frac{i-1}{n},\\frac{i}{n}\\right]\\), we consider the rectangular region with base on the sub-interval and height \\(\\left(\\frac{i-1}{n}\\right)^2\\). The sum of the area of these rectangular regions is smaller than that of the required region. \\[\\begin{align} S_n&amp;=\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot 0^2 + \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right)^2\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1^2+2^2+\\ldots,(n-1)^2}{n}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{n(n-1)(2n-1)}{6n^3}\\\\ &amp;=\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{2n}+\\frac{1}{6n^2} \\tag{5.1} \\end{align}\\] If \\(n\\) is very large, the error is very small and we get a good approximation for the required area. It is clear that if \\(n\\) is very large (so that the error is small), \\(S_n\\) is very close to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Theorem Let \\(f\\) be a function that is continuous on a closed and bounded interval \\([a,b]\\).

All we need is that the lengths are small enough: if \\(a=x_0&lt;x_1&lt;···&lt;x_n=b\\) and \\(\\Delta x_1, \\ldots, \\Delta x_n\\) are small enough, where \\(\\Delta x_i\\) is the length of the \\(i\\)th sub-interval \\([x_{i1},x_i]\\), then for every choice of \\(t_1,\\ldots, t_n\\) with \\(t_i\\in[x_{i1},x_i]\\) for \\(1in\\), the sum (called a Riemann Sum) \\[\\sum_{i=1}^nf(t_i)\\Delta x_i\\] is close to the definite integral \\(\\int_{a}^bf(x)dx\\). That is \\[\\int_{a}^bf(x)dx=\\underset{||\\Delta x||\\rightarrow 0}{\\lim}{\\sum_{i=1}^nf(t_i)\\Delta x_i},\\] where \\(||\\Delta x||\\rightarrow0\\) means the lengths \\(\\Delta x_i\\)’s tend to zero. Remark The symbol \\(\\int\\) was introduced by Leibniz and is called the integral sign. It is an elongated \\(S\\) and was chosen because a deﬁnite integral is a limit of sums.

The numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are called the limits of integration. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus V1 Let \\(f\\) be a function that is continuous on a closed and bounded interval \\([a,b]\\). Let \\(F\\) be the function from \\([a,b]\\) into \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) deﬁned by \\[F(x)=\\int_a^xf(t)dt ~~~ for ~~ a\\leq t \\leq b.\\] Then \\(F\\) is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) and differentiable on \\((a,b)\\) with \\(F&#39;(x)=f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\in(a,b)\\).

If \\(h\\) is small, then the area of the small region under consideration can be approximated by the area of the rectangular region with base \\([x,x+h]\\) on the horizontal axis and height equal to \\(f(x)\\). Thus we have \\[\\int_{x}^{x+h}f(t)dt\\] is close to \\(f(x)\\cdot h\\) if \\(h\\) is small, from which we obtain \\[\\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}=\\frac{\\int_x^{x+h}f(t)dt}{h}\\] is close to \\(f(x)\\) if \\(h\\) is small. Taking limit, we get \\(F&#39;(x)=f(x)\\). Remark To find the definite integral \\(\\int_a^bf(x)dx\\), we should look for functions \\(G\\) such that \\(G&#39;=f\\).

Proof \\(F&#39;(x)=G&#39;(x)\\) for all \\(x\\in(a,b)\\) indicates that at corresponding points (same \\(x\\)-coordinates) tangents to the graphs of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are parallel. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) can be obtained from that of \\(G\\) by moving it upward (\\(C&gt;0\\)) or downward (\\(C&lt;0\\)).

Suppose \\(F\\) is a function defined on \\((a,b)\\) such that \\(F&#39;(x)=f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\in(a,b)\\). Then we say \\(F\\) is an antiderivative for \\(f\\) on \\((a,b)\\). Example \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\), and \\(F(x)=2\\sqrt{x}\\). We have \\(F&#39;(x)=f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\in(0,\\infty)\\).

Suppose that \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are antiderivatives for \\(f\\) on \\((a,b)\\). Then on \\((a,b)\\), the functions \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) differ by a constant. Remark If we can find one antiderivative for a continuous function \\(f\\) on an open interval \\((a,b)\\), then we can find all.

Also, in order to make the equilibrium to exist, d&gt;b. Question 12 Answer : D \\[ x=\\frac{5y+12}{y+3} \\] \\[ x(y+3)=5y+12 \\] \\[ xy+3x=5y+12 \\] \\[ xy-5y=12-3x \\] \\[ (x-5)y=3(4-x) \\] \\[ y = \\frac{3(4-x)}{x-5} \\] Thus, we choose D. Question 13 Answer : C \\[ \\frac{4}{x+2} - \\frac{1}{x-1}\\\\ = \\frac{4(x-1)-(x+2)}{(x+2)(x-1)}\\\\ = \\frac{4x-4-x-2}{(x+2)(x-1)}\\\\ = \\frac{3x-6}{(x+2)(x-1)}\\\\ = \\frac{3(x-2)}{(x+2)(x-1)}\\] Thus, we choose C. Question 14 Answer : E \\[\\begin{cases} ax+by=c\\\\ dx+ey=f \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} d(ax+by)=cd\\\\ a(dx+ey)=af \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} adx+bdy=cd\\\\ adx+aey=af \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2, we get: \\[ (bd-ae)y=cd-af \\] \\[ y = \\frac{cd-af}{bd-ae}\\\\ = \\frac{af-cd}{ae-bd}\\] Substitute y into any equation(we choose equation 1), we get: \\[ ax+b\\frac{af-cd}{ae-bd}=c \\] \\[ ax = c-b\\frac{af-cd}{ae-bd}\\\\ = \\frac{c(ae-bd)-b(af-cd)}{ae-bd}\\\\ = \\frac{ace-bcd-abf+bcd}{ae-bd}\\\\ = \\frac{ace-abf}{ae-bd}\\\\ = \\frac{a(ce-bf)}{ae-bd}\\] Divide both sides by a, we get: \\[ x=\\frac{ce-bf}{ae-bd}\\] Thus, we choose E. Question 15 Answer : A If the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, this shows that the number of equation elements is more than the number of equations. \\[\\begin{cases} x-2y+5z=7\\\\ 2x+3y-2z=-3\\\\ 4x-y+8z=k \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 4(x-2y+5z)=4\\times7\\\\ 2(2x+3y-2z)=-3\\times2\\\\ 4x-y+8z=k \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 4x-8y+20z=28\\\\ 4x+6y-4z=-6\\\\ 4x-y+8z=k \\end{cases}\\] Equation 2 minus equation 1, Equation 2 minus equation 3,we get: \\[\\begin{cases} 7y-12z=-17\\\\ 7y-12z=-6-k \\end{cases}\\] The number of equation elements is more than the number of equations, so the above two equations are equivalent, in other words, \\[ 7y-12z=-17=-6-k \\] \\[ k=11 \\] Thus, we choose A. Question 16 Answer : A As \\[ Y=C+I+G+X-M \\] \\[ Y=(0.7Y+100)+30+50+80-(0.1Y+50) \\] \\[ Y=0.7Y+100+30+50+80-0.1Y-50 \\] \\[ Y-0.7Y+0.1Y= 100+30+50+80-50 \\] \\[ 0.4Y=210 \\] \\[ Y=525 \\] Thus, we choose A. Question 17 Answer : D \\[\\begin{cases} 3x+5y-z=-12\\\\ 2x-3y+2z=22\\\\ x+4y-3z=-10 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 2(3x+5y-z)=-12\\times2\\\\ 3(2x-3y+2z)=22\\times3\\\\ 6(x+4y-3z)=-10\\times6 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 6x+10y-2z)=-24\\\\ 6x-9y+6z)=66\\\\ 6x+24y-18z)=-60 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2, Equation 3 minus equation 2,we get: \\[\\begin{cases} 19y-8z=-90\\\\ 33y-24z=-126 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 3(19y-8z)=-90\\times3\\\\ 33y-24z=-126 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 57y-24z=-270\\\\ 33y-24z=-126 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 24y=-144 \\] \\[ y=-6 \\] Substitute y into one of the equation(we choose equation 33y-24z=-126), we get: \\[ 33\\times(-6)-24z=-126 \\] \\[ z=-3 \\] Thus, we choose D. Question 18 Answer : C As the price of a complementary good decreases, the demand of the good that we care about increases, the supply of the good doesn’t shift.Thus, the demand curve of the good shifts right, and the equilibrium price and quantity both increases. We choose C. Examination questions Question 1 (a) The graphs are omitted, please refer to textbook answers(page 672 ). (b) The distance is 12. (c) EatMeNow : y=9+0.5x Deliver4U: y=1.25x \\[\\begin{cases} y=9+0.5x\\\\ y=1.25x \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 0=9+0.5x-1.25x\\\\ =9-0.75x\\] \\[ x=12 \\] It’s the same answer you got in part (b). Question 2 (a) When P=5, substitute P=5 into the demand function, we can get the quantity demand, that is: \\[ Q_D = 400-15\\times5\\\\ = 325 \\] When P=5, substitute P=5 into the supply function, we can get the quantity supply, that is: \\[ Q_S = -50+10\\times5\\\\ = 0 \\] When P=10, \\[ Q_D = 400-15\\times10\\\\ = 250 \\] \\[ Q_S = -50+10\\times10\\\\ = 50 \\] When P=15, \\[ Q_D = 400-15\\times15\\\\ = 175 \\] \\[ Q_S = -50+10\\times15\\\\ = 100 \\] When P=20, \\[ Q_D = 400-15\\times20\\\\ = 100 \\] \\[ Q_S = -50+10\\times20\\\\ = 150 \\] When P=25, \\[ Q_D = 400-15\\times25\\\\ = 25 \\] \\[ Q_S = -50+10\\times25\\\\ = 200 \\] The graphs are omitted, please refer to textbook answers(page 673 ). (b) \\[\\begin{cases} Q=400-15P\\\\ Q=-50+10P \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 0=(400-15P)-(-50+10P)\\\\ =450-25P \\] \\[ P=18 \\] \\[ Q=400-15P\\\\ =400-15\\times18\\\\ =130 \\] Thus, the equilibrium price is 18 and the equilibrium quantity is 130. (c) As you can see in the graphs, to the left of the equilibrium point, when P&lt;18, the demand curve is above the supply curve, there is excess demand. (d) When a fixed tax of $5 is imposed, the supply function is changed, the price in the supply function is reduced by 5 on each good, that is: \\[ Q_S = -50+10(P-5) \\\\ = -100+10P\\] \\[\\begin{cases} Q=400-15P\\\\ Q=-100+10P \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 0=(400-15P)-(-100+10P)\\\\ =500-25P \\] \\[ P=20 \\] \\[ Q=400-15P\\\\ =400-15\\times20\\\\ =100 \\] Thus, the new equilibrium price is 20 and the equilibrium quantity is 100. Question 3 (a) P and Q are negatively correlated in the demand equation; P and Q are positively correlated in the supply equation.Thus, the first equation represents the demand curve, and the second equation represents the supply curve. (b) In order to get the values of slope and vertical intercept, we transform the equation. \\[ Q+3P=48 \\] \\[ 3P=-Q+48 \\] \\[ P=-\\frac{Q}{3}+16 \\] Thus, the coefficient of Q is the slope, and when Q=0, the P value obtained is the vertical intercept.So for the demand curve, the slope is -1/3, the vertical intercept is 16. (c) \\[\\begin{cases} Q+3P=48\\\\ Q-2P=30 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 3P+2P=48-30 \\] \\[ 5P=18 \\] \\[ P=3.6 \\] Substitute P into one of the equation(we choose equation 1), we get: \\[ Q+3\\times3.6=48 \\] \\[ Q=37.2 \\] Thus, the equilibrium price is 3.6, the equilibrium quantity is 37.2. Question 4 (a) As \\[ Y=C+I+G \\] Substitute C,I,G into the function, we get: \\[ Y= (0.75Y_d+150)+100+250 \\\\ = [0.75(Y-T)+150]+100+250\\\\ = [0.75(Y-50)+150]+100+250\\\\ = 0.75Y-0.75\\times50+150+100+250\\] \\[ Y-0.75Y=-37.5+150+100+250\\] \\[ 0.25Y=462.5 \\] \\[ Y=1850 \\] Thus, the equilibrium level of national income is 1850. (b) \\[ Y = C+I+G\\\\ = (0.75Y_d+150)+(I+G)\\\\ = [0.75(Y-T)+150]+(I+G)\\\\ = 0.75Y-0.75T+150+(I+G)\\] \\[ 0.25Y = -0.75T+150+(I+G) \\] Substitute Y=1850+20=1870,T=50 into the function, we get: \\[ 0.25\\times1870 = -0.75\\times50+150+(I+G) \\] \\[ I+G = 355 \\] The total increase in G and I is 5 as follows. \\[ 355-(100+250)=5 \\] Question 5 (a) Substitute K=40,L=30 into the function, we get: \\[ Q = \\frac{KL}{K+2L}\\\\ = \\frac{40\\times30}{40+2\\times30}\\\\ = \\frac{1200}{100}\\\\ = 12\\] (b) Substitute Q=4,K=10 into the function, we get: \\[ 4 = \\frac{10L}{10+2L}\\] \\[ 40+8L = 10L \\] \\[ 40 = 2L \\] \\[ L=20 \\] (c) \\[ Q = \\frac{KL}{K+2L}\\] \\[ Q(K+2L)=KL \\] \\[ QK+2QL=KL \\] \\[ KL-QK=2QL \\] \\[ K(L-Q)=2QL \\] \\[ K=\\frac{2QL}{L-Q} \\] Question 6 (a) \\[ C+I=0.75Y+18+22\\\\ =0.75Y+40 \\] When Y=0, \\[ C+I = 0.75\\times0+40\\\\ =40 \\] When Y=100, \\[ C+I = 0.75\\times100+40\\\\ =115 \\] When Y=200, \\[ C+I = 0.75\\times200+40\\\\ =190 \\] The graphs are omitted, please refer to textbook answers(page 673 ). \\[ Y = C+I = 0.75Y+40 \\] \\[ 0.25Y=40 \\] \\[ Y=160 \\] Thus, the equilibrium level of national income is 160. The equilibrium level of national income decreases, you can refer to textbook answers(page 673 ). Question 7 (a) These goods are substitutable. As in the demand function for good 1, the coefficient of P2 is positive, which means that when the demand for good 1 rises, the price of good 2 increases so that the demand for good 2 decreases. It is the same in the demand function for good 2. (b) To get the equilibrium price and quantity,we use \\[ Q_D = Q_S\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 120-2P_1+P_2=-7+7P_1\\\\ 168+3P_1-7P_2=-3+20P_2 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=127\\\\ 3P_1-27P_2=-171 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=127\\\\ 3(3P_1-27P_2)=-171\\times3 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=127\\\\ 3(3P_1-27P_2)=-171\\times3 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[80P_2=640 \\] \\[ P_2 = 8 \\] Substitute the value into any equation (we choose equation 1) \\[ 120-2P_1+8 ==-7+7P_1 \\] \\[ P_1=15 \\] \\[ Q_1 = -7+7P_1\\\\ = -7+7\\times15\\\\ = 98 \\] \\[ Q_2 = -3+20P_2\\\\ = -3+20\\times8\\\\ = 157 \\] The equilibrium price and quantity for good 1 are 15 and 98;The equilibrium price and quantity for good 2 are 8 and 157. (c) As there is a subsidy of $4 on good 1, the subsidy have effect on the supply function, so \\[ P_1&#39; = P_1 + 4 \\] So \\[ Q_{D_1} = 120-2P_1+P_2 ; Q_{S2} = -7+7{P_1}&#39;\\\\ Q_{D_1} = 168+3P_1-7P_2 ; Q_{S2} = -3+20{P_2}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 120-2P_1+P_2=-7+7(P_1+4)\\\\ 168+3P_1-7P_2=-3+20P_2 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=99\\\\ 3P_1-27P_2=-171 \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 9P_1-P_2=99\\\\ 3(3P_1-27P_2)=-171\\times3 \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[80P_2=612\\] \\[ P_2 = 7.65 \\] Substitute the value into any equation (we choose equation 1) \\[ 120-2P_1+P_2=-7+7(P_1+4) \\] \\[ 120-2P_1+7.65=-7+7(P_1+4) \\] \\[P_1 = 11.85 \\] \\[11.85-15=-3.15 \\\\ 7.65-8=-0.35 \\] For good 1, the equilibrium price reduces by $3.15;For good 2, the equilibrium price reduces by $0.35. Question 8 (a) \\[ 3f+4s \\leq 3000 \\] Substitute s=270 into the function, we get: \\[ 3f+4\\times270 \\leq 3000 \\] \\[ 3f \\leq 3000-4\\times270 \\] \\[ 3f\\leq 1920 \\] \\[ f \\leq 640 \\] Thus, the maximum amount of flour is 640kg. (b) (i)\\[ P=\\frac{36}{2Q+5}\\\\ =\\frac{36}{2\\times3.5+5}\\\\ =\\frac{36}{12}\\\\ =3 \\] (ii)\\[ P=2.4\\\\ =\\frac{36}{2Q+5}\\] \\[ 2.4(2Q+5)=36 \\] \\[ 4.8Q+12=36 \\] \\[ 4.8Q=24 \\] \\[ Q=5 \\] (iii)\\[ P=\\frac{36}{2Q+5} \\] \\[ P(2Q+5)=36 \\] \\[ 2PQ+5P=36 \\] \\[ 2PQ=36-5P \\] \\[ Q=\\frac{36-5P}{2P} \\] (c) As \\[ Y=C+S \\] \\[ S=Y-C\\\\ =Y-\\frac{Y^2 + 100}{Y+2}\\\\ =\\frac{Y(Y+2)-(Y^2 + 100)}{Y+2}\\\\ =\\frac{Y^2+2Y-Y^2-100}{Y+2}\\\\ =\\frac{2Y-100}{Y+2}\\] Question 9 (a) Firstly, we get x and y expressed by m and n. \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ 3x+my=n \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 3(2x+6y)=3\\\\ 2(3x+my)=2n \\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[(18-2m)y=3-2n\\] \\[ y=\\frac{3-2n}{2(9-m)}\\] Substitute the value of y into any equation (we choose equation 1) \\[ 2x+6(\\frac{3-2n}{2(9-m)}) =1\\] \\[ x= \\frac{6n-m}{2(9-m)} \\] Thus, when m=9, the system fail to possess a unique solution. When m=9, \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ 3x+9y=n \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ \\frac{2}{3}(3x+9y)=\\frac{2}{3}n \\end{cases}\\] \\[\\begin{cases} 2x+6y=1\\\\ 2x+3y=\\frac{2}{3}n\\end{cases}\\] Equation 1 minus equation 2,we get: \\[ 0 = 1-\\frac{2}{3}n \\] When m=9, n = 1.5, the above equation(0=1-2/3n) exits, the two equations in the system of equations are equivalent, so the system has infinite solutions;When\\[ m=9, n \\neq1.5\\], the above equation(0=1-2/3n) doesn’t exit, the system doesn’t have any solution.

As the MPC decreases, the slope of the function(C = 0.6Y+60) decreases, we assume it decreases to be a, then a&lt;0.6 .
