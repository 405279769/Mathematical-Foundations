Rules for exponents \\(a^ma^n=a^{m+n}\\) \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}\\) \\((a^m)^n=a^{mn}\\) \\((ab)^n=a^nb^n\\) \\(\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^n=\\frac{a^n}{b^n}\\) Algebraic Identities and Algebraic Expressions Identities Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be real numbers. Then we have \\((a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2\\) \\((a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2\\) \\((a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2\\) Solving Linear Equations Definition A solution to \\(F(x)=0\\) is a real number \\(x_0\\) such that \\(F(x_0)=0\\). Definition We say that two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution(s). Solving Quadratic Equations A quadratic equation (in one unknown) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[ax^2+bx+c=0\\] where \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants and \\(a\\neq0\\). To solve this equations, we can use the Factorization Method or the Quadratic Formula. Quadratic Formula Solutions to Equation \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\) are given by \\[x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\\] \\(b^2‚àí4ac\\) is called the discriminant Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem Remainder Theorem If a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) is divided by \\(x‚àíc\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant, the remainder is \\(p(c)\\). Factor Theorem \\((x‚àíc)\\) is a factor of a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) if and only if \\(p(c)=0\\). Solving Linear Inequalities Definition A solution to an inequality \\(F(x)&lt;0\\) is a real number \\(x_0\\) such that \\(F(x0)&lt;0\\). The definition also applies to other types of inequalities. Rules for Inequalities Let \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) be real numbers. Then the following holds. If \\(a&lt;b\\), then \\(a+c&lt;b+c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c&gt;0\\), then \\(ac&lt;bc\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c&lt;0\\), then \\(ac&gt;bc\\). Note: The inequality is reversed. If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(b‚â§c\\), then \\(a&lt;c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have the same sign, then \\(\\frac{1}{a}&gt;\\frac{1}{b}\\). Lines A line equation in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[ax+by+c=0\\] where \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants with \\(a,b\\) not both \\(0\\). More generally, an equation in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an equation that can be written in the form \\[F(x,y)=0\\] where \\(F\\) is a function (from a collection of ordered pairs into \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)). Definition An ordered pair (of real numbers) is a pair of real numbers \\(x_0\\), \\(y_0\\) enclosed in side parenthesis: \\((x_0,y_0)\\). Definition A solution to Equation (??) is an ordered pair \\((x_0,y_0)\\) such that \\(F(x_0,y_0)=0\\). Rectangular Coordinate System Given a plane, there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in the plane and ordered pairs of real numbers. The plane described in this way is called the Cartesian plane or the rectangular coordinate plane. The \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes divide the (rectangular) coordinate plane into 4 regions (called quadrants): Quadrant I = \\(\\{(a;b):a&gt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&gt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant II = \\(\\{(a;b):a&lt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&gt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant III = \\(\\{(a;b):a&lt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&lt;0 \\}\\); Quadrant IV = \\(\\{(a;b):a&gt;0~~ \\text{and}~~ b&lt;0 \\}\\); Lines in the Coordinate Plane Consider the following equation \\[\\begin{equation} Ax+By+C=0 \\tag{0.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(A,B\\) and \\(C\\) are constants with \\(A,B\\) not both zero. It is not difficult to see that the equation has infinitely many solutions. Each solution \\((x_0,y_0)\\) represents a point in the (rectangular) coordinate plane. The collection of all solutions (points) form a line, called the graph of Equation (0.1). Definition For a non-vertical line \\(l\\), its slope (denoted by \\(m\\)) is defined to be \\[m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\] where \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) are any two distinct points lying on the line. Equations for Lines Let \\(l\\) be a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane. Suppose \\((x_1,y_1)\\) is a point lying on \\(l\\) and \\(m\\) is the slope. Then an equation for \\(l\\) can be written in the form \\[y‚àíy_1=m(x‚àíx_1)\\] called a point-slope form for \\(l\\). Suppose the \\(y\\)-intercept of \\(l\\) is \\((0,b)\\) and the slope of \\(l\\) is \\(m\\). Then a point-slope form for \\(l\\) is \\[y‚àíb=m(x‚àí0)\\] which can be written as \\[y=mx+b\\] called the slope-intercept form for \\(l\\). Parallel and Perpendicular Lines Let \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) be (non-vertical) lines with slopes \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) respectively. Then \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) are parallel if and only if \\(m_1=m_2\\). \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) are perpendicular to each other if and only if \\(m_1\\cdot m_2=-1\\). Pythagoras Theorem, Distance Formula and Circles Pythagoras Theorem Let \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\) be the (lengths of the) sides of a right-angled triangle where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.Then we have \\[a^2+b^2=c^2\\] Distance Formula Let \\(P=(x1,y1)\\) and \\(Q=(x2,y2)\\). Then the distance \\(PQ\\) between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is \\[PQ=(x_2‚àíx_1)^2+(y_2‚àíy_1)^2\\] Equation of Circles Let \\(C\\) be the circle with center at \\((h,k)\\) and radius \\(r\\). Then an equation for \\(C\\) is \\[(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2\\] Parabola The graph of \\[y=ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\neq 0\\), is a parabola. The parabola intersects the \\(x\\)-axis at two distinct points if \\(b^2‚àí4ac&gt;0\\). It touches the \\(x\\)-axis (one intersection point only) if \\(b^2‚àí4ac=0\\) and does not intersect the \\(x\\)-axis if \\(b^2‚àí4ac&lt;0\\). If \\(a&gt;0\\), the parabola opens upward and there is a lowest point (called the vertex of the parabola). If \\(a&lt;0\\), the parabola opens downward and there is a highest point (vertex). The vertical line that passes through the vertex is called the axis of symmetry because the parabola is symmetric about this line. Systems of Equations A system of two equations in two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be written as \\[ \\begin{cases} F_1(x,y)=0\\\\ F_2(x,y)=0 \\end{cases} \\] Usually, each equation represents a curve in the coordinate plane. Solving the system means to find all ordered pairs \\((x_0,y_0)\\) such that \\(F_1(x_0,y_0)=0\\) and \\(F_2(x_0,y_0)=0\\), that is, to find all points \\((x_0,y_0)\\) that lies on the intersection of the two curves. To solve a system of two linear equations (with two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) \\[ \\begin{cases} ax+by+c=0\\\\ dx+ey+f=0 \\end{cases} \\] we can use elimination or substitution. "],["sets-real-numbers-and-inequalities.html", "1 Sets, Real Numbers and Inequalities 1.1 Sets 1.2 Real Numbers 1.3 Solving Inequalities", " 1 Sets, Real Numbers and Inequalities 1.1 Sets 1.1.1 Introduction Idea of definition: A set is a collection of objects. Terminology An object in a set is called an element or a member of the set. To describe sets, we can use listing or description. Listing List all the elements in a set, e.g., \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) is the set containing three elements. Description Describe a common property of the elements of the set, using the following notation: \\[\\{x:P(x)\\}~~~\\text{or}~~~ \\{x|p(x)\\}\\] read ‚Äúthe set of all \\(x\\) such that \\(P(x)\\) (is true)‚Äù. For example \\(\\{x:x ~~\\text{is a positive integer less than 101}\\}=\\{1,\\ldots,100\\}=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:x\\le100\\}\\). Notations The set of all real numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The set of all rational numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The set of all integers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). The set of all positive integers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}_+\\). The set of all all natural numbers is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Example \\(2\\in\\mathbb{N}, 2\\in\\mathbb{Q},\\pi\\in\\mathbb{R},\\pi\\notin\\mathbb{Q}\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,2,\\ldots,100\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{2,3,4,5\\}\\). Then every element of set \\(B\\) is also an element of set \\(A\\). The equity means assigning a name to a set, i.e., the set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,100\\}\\) is denoted by \\(A\\). Sometimes, we use the symbol \\(:=\\). Notation Given an object \\(x\\) and a set \\(A\\), either \\(x\\) is an element of \\(A\\) denoted by \\(x\\in A\\) or \\(x\\) is not an element of \\(A\\) denoted by \\(x\\notin A\\). Definition The set that has no element is called the empty set denoted by \\(\\emptyset\\). Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. If every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\) and vice versa, then we say that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal, denotedby \\(A=B\\). Otherwise, we say that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are unequal, denoted by \\(A\\neq B\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}\\) and let \\(B=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+: x ~~\\text{is a prime number less than 10}\\}\\). Then we have \\(A\\neq B\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,2,3\\}\\) and let \\(B=\\{1,3,2\\}\\). Then we have \\(A=B\\). Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. If every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\), then we say that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\subseteq B\\). Otherwise, we say that \\(A\\) is not a subset of \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\nsubseteq B\\). Note \\(A\\subseteq A\\) \\(A=B\\) if and only if \\(A\\subseteq B\\) and \\(B\\subseteq A\\). \\(A\\nsubseteq B\\) means that there is at least one element of \\(A\\) that is not an element of \\(B\\). Example Let \\(A=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\), \\(B=\\{1,3,5\\}\\), \\(C=\\{2,4,6\\}\\). Then we have \\(B\\subseteq A\\) and \\(C\\nsubseteq A\\). 1.1.2 Set operations Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. The intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\cap B\\), is the set whose elements are those belonging to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that is \\[A\\cap B=\\{x:x\\in A ~~\\text{and}~~x\\in B\\}.\\] The union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A\\cup B\\), is the set whose elements are those belonging to either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) or both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that is \\[A\\cup B=\\{x: x\\in A ~~\\text{or}~~x\\in B\\}.\\] Example Let \\(A=\\{2,3,5\\}\\), \\(B=\\{2,5,6,8\\}\\) and \\(C=\\{1,2,3\\}\\). Find the following sets: \\(A\\cap B\\), \\(A\\cup B\\), \\((A\\cap B)\\cap C\\), \\(A\\cap (B\\cap C)\\). Associative Set intersection and set union are associative. \\[(A\\cap B)\\cap C=A\\cap(B\\cap C)\\] \\[(A\\cup B)\\cup C=A\\cup(B\\cup C)\\] Definition Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. The relative complement of \\(B\\) in \\(A\\), denoted by \\(A\\backslash B\\) or \\(A-B\\), is the set whose elements are those belonging to \\(A\\) but not belonging to \\(B\\), that is, \\[A\\backslash B=\\{x\\in A:x\\notin B\\}.\\] Example Let \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{c,d,e\\}\\). Then we have \\(A\\backslash B=\\{a,b\\}.\\) Universal set A large enough set containing all objects under consideration, denoted by \\(U\\). Example In considering whole numbers, we may use \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) as a universal set. The set of all prime numbers can be written as \\(\\{x\\in\\mathbb{Z}:x&gt;0 ~\\text{and}~x~ \\text{has exactly two divisors} \\}\\). Definition Let \\(U\\) be a universal set and let \\(B\\) be a subset of \\(U\\). Then the set \\(U\\backslash B\\) is called the complement of \\(B\\) (in \\(U\\)) and is denoted by \\(B&#39;\\) (or \\(B^c\\)).
