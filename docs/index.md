# üë®‚Äçüè´ Welcome  {-}

This is the website of Mathematical Foundations. We create this website  to 

- Summarize the key concepts of each chapter.

- Provide the solutions to `Multiple choice questions` and `Examination questions` at the end of each chapter.

- Answer the important questions raised by students.

- Clarify possible confusions due to language.

This website is maintained by <u>Guangyuan Gao</u> and <u>Yan Cai</u>. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us via <guangyuan.gao@ruc.edu.cn> or <2017201678@ruc.edu.cn>.

## üñäÔ∏è Homework {-}

‚ùó Examination Questions 1-5 on page 193 is due on **2020/10/20 18:00 Beijing Time)**. 

‚ùó We  will continue with GNP applications in more details  and explain the exponential and logarithm function more in the next lecture. So homework is due on next Tuesday.

You should send either a typed document or a scanned/photoed handwritten manuscript to the tutor's email address <2017201678@ruc.edu.cn>. You should show the **calculation/proof details** in your submitted document.

Please name the subject of your email as `your uni id-chapter-question numbers`, e.g.,  `u2017201678-Chapter1-Q1-Q5`.

The solutions to homework will be announced in this website. 

To get the most of mathematics, you should practice as much as possible.
Our homework is far from enough to master the knowledge in the textbook. **You are strongly recommended to try all the questions in the textbook.**

## ü§î Q and A {-}

**I will update this section frequently to answer the important questions. You are welcomed to ask questions!**

**üëâ Components of the final result** (2020/10/11)
 
Final result = Attending zoom lecture (10%) + Homework (60%) + Final exam (30%).

At this moment, the final examination (open book) is scheduled on **2021/01/14 during the last lecture of week 19**. However, the schedule may be changed due to unforeseeable events.
