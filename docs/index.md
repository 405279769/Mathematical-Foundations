# üë®‚Äçüè´ Welcome  {-}

This is the website of Mathematical Foundations. We create this website  to 

- Summarize the key concepts of each chapter.

- Provide the solutions to the selected questions of each chapter.

- Answer the important questions raised by students.

- Clarify possible confusions due to language.

This website is maintained by <u>Guangyuan Gao</u> and <u>Yan Cai</u>. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us via <guangyuan.gao@ruc.edu.cn> or <2017201678@ruc.edu.cn>.

Homework: Exercise 5.6* (page 470) Q1, Q4, Q7, Q9, Q11 Exercise 6.1* (page 497) Q1, Q10, Q12, Q13 are due on **2020/Dec/15 (18:00 Beijing Time)**. 

You should send either a typed document or a scanned/photoed handwritten manuscript to the tutor's email address <2017201678@ruc.edu.cn>. You should show the **calculation/proof details** in your submitted document.

Please name the subject of your email as `your uni id-chapter-question numbers`, e.g.,  `u2017201678-Chapter1-Q1-Q5`.

The solutions to homework will be announced in this website. 

To get the most of mathematics, you should practice as much as possible.
Our homework is far from enough to master the knowledge in the textbook. **You are strongly recommended to try all the questions in the textbook.**

## ü§î Q and A {-}

**I will update this section frequently to answer the important questions. You are welcomed to ask questions!**
