## Week 2 {-}

### Problem 1 {-}

AV in 2 years = 1173.54, so we set: 
$$1173.54=1000\left(1+\frac{K}{4}\right)^{4}\left(1-\frac{K}{4}\right)^{-4}=1000\left(\frac{4+K}{4-K}\right)^{4}$$
Thus,
$$\frac{4+K}{4-K}=1.17354^{1/4}=1.0408$$
Solving for K, we get:
$$K=0.08$$


### Problem 2 {-}
AV in 8 years:

**Fund X**:$$e^{(0.05)(8)}=e^{0.4}$$
**Fund Y**:$$\left(1+\frac{j}{2}\right)^{(2)(8)}=\left(1+\frac{j}{2}\right)^{16}$$
At the end of eight years, Fund $X$ is 1.05 times as large as Fund $Y$, so we set:
$$e^{0.4}=1.05\left(1+\frac{j}{2}\right)^{16}$$
Thus,
$$j=2\left[\left(\frac{e^{0.4}}{1.05}\right)^{\frac{1}{16}}-1\right]=0.044$$

### Problem 3 {-}

Fund $X$ equals Fund $Y$ at the end of four years, so we set:
$$1000(1.04)^{6}(1+i)=1000e^{\int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{(15-t)} dt}$$
Then,
$$1000e^{\int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{(15-t)} dt}=1000e^{-\ln(15-t)|_{0}^{4}}=1000\left(\frac{15}{11}\right)$$

Thus,
$$(1+i)=\frac{15}{(11)(1.04)^6}=1.0777$$
$$i=0.0777$$


## Week 1 {-}

### Problem 1 {-}

To compare the two funds, we assume that equal investments of $X$ are made at time 0.

John's **accumulation function** is $$t^2+2t+1$$

Edna's **accumulation function** is $$2t^{2}+1$$

To determine when Edna's investment exceeds John's, we set:

$$ X(2t^{2}+1)>X(t^{2}+2t+1)$$

which reduces to:

$$t^{2}-2t>0$$ or $$t(t-2)>0$$

Thus, Edna's fund exceeds John's after 2 years.


### Problem 2 {-}

$$PV=1000v+2000v^{3}=2540.15 $$

since $$v=1.075^{-1}$$


### Problem 3 {-}

Discounting at $10\%$, the net present values are $4.59$,$-2.36$ and $-9.54$ for Projects A,B,and C respectively.

Take Project A as an example:

$$NPV=-800+500v+500v^{2}-175v^{3}+100v^{4}=4.59$$ 

since $$v=1.10^{-1}$$

Hence, only Project A should be funded.
