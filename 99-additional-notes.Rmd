**Formula for slope** Suppose a curve $C$ is given by $y=f(x)$, where $f$ is a function; and a point $P(x_0;f(x_0))$ is a point on $C$. For any point $Q$ on $C$ with $Q\neq P$, its $x$-coordinate can be written as $x_0+h$ where $h\neq 0$ (if $h>0$, $Q$ is on the right of $P$; if $h<0$, Q is on the left of $P$). Thus, $Q$ can be written as $(x_0+h;f(x_0+h))$. The slope $m_{PQ} of the secant line $PQ$ is
$$m_{PQ}=\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{(x_0+h)-x_0}=\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}$$
Note that as $Q$ approaches $P$, the number $h$ approaches 0. From these, we see that the slope of $C$ at $P$ (denoted by $m_p$) is 

\begin{equation}
m_p=\underset{h\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h} (\#eq:mp)
\end{equation}


provided that the limit exists.

**Example** Find the slope of the curve $y=x^2$ at the point $P(3,9)$.


**Definition** Let $x_0$ be a real number and let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval containing $x_0$. Suppose the limit in \@ref(eq:mp) exists. Then we say that $f$ is *differentiable* at $x_0$.

**Example** Let $f(x)=|x|$. The domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$. The function $f$ is continuous at $0$. However it is not differetiable at $0$.

*Definition** Let $f$ be a function that is differetiable at some points belonging in its domain. Then the derivative of $f$, denoted by $f'$, is the function (from a subset of $\text{dom}(f)$ into $\mathbb{R}$) given by
$$f'(x)=\underset{h\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
where the domain of $f'$ is $\{x\in\text{dom}(f):\underset{h\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}~~ \text{exits} \}$

**Example** Find the derivative of $f(x)=|x|$.

**Example** Find the derivative of $f(x)=x^2$.

**Example** Find the derivative of $f(x)=x^3$.

**Notation**

- To denote the derivative of a function $f$, we have the following notations.

  $$f',f'(x),y',\frac{dy}{dx},\frac{d}{dx}y,\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$$

- To denote the derivative of $f$ at $x_0$, we have the following notations.

  $$f'(x_0),y'(x_0),\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=x_0}$$
  
**Caution** $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is not a fraction, but a function in $x$.  

**Prove the following rules of differentiation**

**Rate of change** The slope of a curve $y=f(x)$ at a point $P(x_0,f(x_0))$  is the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ at $P$. That is, $f'(x_0)$ is the rate of change of $y$ w.r.t. $x$ when $x=x_0$.

**Derivative of Identity Function** The derivative of the identity function is the constant function 1. *How to prove*

**Power Rule for Differentiation (positive integer version)** Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then the power function $x^n$ is differentiate on $\mathbb{R}$ and we have $$\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}$$

**Product Rule** Let $f$ and $g$ be functions with the same domain. Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are differentiable. Then the function $fg$ is also differentiable. Moreover, we have $$\frac{d}{dx}(fg)(x)=g(x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}f(x)+f(x)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}g(x)$$

**Area under a curve** Find the area of the region that lies under the curve $y=x^2$ and above the $x$-axis for $x$ between $0$ and $1$.

- First we divide the interval $[0,1]$ into finitely many sub-intervals of equal lengths:
  $$\left[0,\frac{1}{n}\right],\left[\frac{1}{n},\frac{2}{n}\right],\ldots,\left[\frac{n-1}{n},1\right].$$
  
- For each sub-interval $\left[\frac{i-1}{n},\frac{i}{n}\right]$, we consider the rectangular region with base on the sub-interval and height $\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\right)^2$.
The sum of the area of these rectangular regions is smaller than that of the required region.


\begin{align}
S_n&=\frac{1}{n}\cdot 0^2 + \frac{1}{n}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\cdot\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^2\\
&=\frac{1^2+2^2+\ldots,(n-1)^2}{n}\\
&=\frac{n(n-1)(2n-1)}{6n^3}\\
&=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{6n^2} (\#eq:area)
\end{align}

- If $n$ is very large, the error is very small and we get a good approximation for the required area. It is clear that if $n$ is very large (so that the error is small), $S_n$ is very close to $\frac{1}{3}$.

**Theorem** Let $f$ be a function that is continuous on a closed and bounded interval $[a,b]$. Then the following limit exists:
$$\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_{i-1})\cdot\frac{b-a}{n}$$
where $x_i=a+\frac{i}{n}(b-a)$ for $0\le i\le n$.

**Definition** Let $f$ be a function that is continuous on a closed and bounded interval $[a,b]$. The number $\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_{i-1})\cdot\frac{b-a}{n}$, where $x_i=a+\frac{i}{n}(b-a)$ for $0\le i\le n$ is called the **definite integral** of $f$ from $a$ to $b$ and is denoted by $\int_{a}^bf(x)dx$, that is 
$$\int_{a}^bf(x)dx=\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_{i-1})\cdot\frac{b-a}{n}$$

In the notation $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$  the variable $x$ is called a dummy variable; it can be replaced by any other symbol. For example $\int_{0}^1t^2dt=\frac{1}{3}$.


**Example** The result in \@ref(eq:area) can be written as 
$$\int_{0}^1x^2dx=\frac{1}{3}$$

**Example** Use the definition to find $\int_1^2xdx$

**Rules for Definite Integrals** Let $f$ and $g$ be functions that are continuous on a closed and bounded interval $[a,b]$. Let $\alpha$ be a constant and let $c\in(a;b)$. Then we have

1. $$\int_a^b[f(x)+g(x)]dx=\int_a^bf(x)dx+\int_a^bg(x)dx$$

2. $$\int_a^b\alpha f(x)dx=\alpha\int_a^b f(x)dx$$

3. $$\int_a^b\alpha f(x)dx=\int_a^c f(x)dx+\int_c^b f(x)dx$$

**Terminology** In a definite integral $\int_a^bf(x)dx$,

- The function $f$ is called the integrand.

- The numbers $a$ and $b$ are called the limits of integration.

**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus V1** Let $f$ be a function that is continuous on a closed and bounded interval $[a,b]$. Let $F$ be the function from $[a,b]$ into $\mathbb{R}$ deﬁned by
$$F(x)=\int_a^xf(t)dt ~~~ for ~~ a\leq t \leq b.$$

Then $F$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in(a,b)$.

**Definition** Let $f$ be a function that is continuous on a closed and bounded interval $[a,b]$. Suppose that $G$ is a function that is defined on $[a,b]$ such that the following two conditions are satisfied:

1. $G$ is continuous on $[a,b]$;

2. $G$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $G'(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in(a,b)$.

Then we say that $G$ is a **primitive** for $f$ on $[a,b]$.
